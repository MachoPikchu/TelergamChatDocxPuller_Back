    "content": "2317 Worm of Doubt\n\nSunny let out a long sigh, then fell into contemplation. He studied the grid for a while, his eyes hidden in deep shadow… eventually, though, he glanced at Kai.\n\n'We lack information about the rules of this world, and trying to learn more about it through trial and error seems too dangerous. This places us in an unfortunately passive position. We have no choice - no better choice, at least - than to wait for the adversary to mаke their move. We will be able to understand more about Ariel's Game by watching the Snow Abominations act.'\n\nHe grimaced.\n\n'You mentioned that the insects in the ice hive seemed to be slowly awakening, while the other two Beasts have not moved yet. It is not surprising, really, considering that they must have spent thousands of years imprisoned in this game. But… now that we are here, they'll probably come to their senses soon.'\n\nSunny considered Kai for a few seconds, thеn asked:\n\n'In the meantime… you led soldiers in your Second Nightmare and in Antarctica, didn't you? You also spent enough time with Morgan to learn a thing or two from her. What do you think our strategy should be?'\n\nKai raised an eyebrow and hesitated for a few seconds.\n\n'I… am a bit surprised to hear about my Second Nightmare from you, Sunny. But if you know what happened to us in the Kingdom of Hope, you know that the only thing I led my soldiers to was their deaths. As for Antarctica, my role there was merely that of a tactical commander. Our broader strategy was usually decided by the Army HQ.'\n\nSunny smiled.\n\n'Nightingale… Kai, my friend. I know that you are plagued by insecurity, but please, for the love of gods, don't let it fester into an inferiority complex on my account. Excessive modesty is not a flattering look for a distinguished gentleman - even one as dashing as you. So cut it out and take accountability for your accomplishments, for once.'\n\nKai glanced at him, a peculiar emotion hidden in his gorgeous green eyes.\n\nSunny sighed.\n\nThe charming Saint was often too nice for his own good, but that was not his only character flaw. He was also unsure of himself, deep down. Sunny knew that Kai had always felt somewhat insecure about his place in the cohort… and as a result, in the broader world.\n\nHe could understand these doubts, to a degree. After all, the members of Changing Star's cohort were exceptional individuals, each and every one of them - ever since the Forgotten Shore. There was Nephis herself, Cassie and her prophetic gift, Sunny and his Fated encounters, and Effie, who had survived years hunting alone on the streets of the Dark City.\n\nLater, there was also Soul Reaper Jet - a Master whom even Saints feared.\n\nIn comparison, Kai was a far more mundane individual. He had survived the perils of the Dark City behind the walls of the Bright Castle, earning soul shards to pay Gunlaug's tribute by selling his rare Aspect Ability. In a sense, he was more similar to someone like Aiko than to the exalted warriors around him.\n\nAnd yet, Kai had risen to the occasion every time his help had been needed - for no other reason than his innate integrity and principles. He was not driven by an overwhelming obsession or forced into action by inescapable fate… instead, he simply did his best to do what he felt was the right thing to do.\n\nFrom the harrowing reaches of the Forgotten Shore to the dark expanse of the Tomb of Ariel, he elevated himself step by step until there was hardly a handful of people in the world who could say that they had accomplished more, and endured more, than Saint Nightingale - the heroic Dragonslayer.\n\nIt was just that Kai's opinion of himself never seemed to catch up to his accomplishments.\n\nSunny may not have liked that his friend was always selling himself short, but there was little he could do about it. After all, there was some truth to what Kai thought about himself - it would have been hard for anyone, not just him, to contend against inexplicable monsters like Sunny, Nephis, or other powerhouses in their orbit.\n\nBut now… now, Kai's insecurity was not merely undeserved, it was an actual problem. Sovereigns were arrogant by nature, after all - they had to be. Only someone supremely confident in their cause could be bold enough to force their will upon the world.\n\nHow could someone who doubted himself convince the world to submit?\n\nSo, Sunny hoped to disabuse Kai of the preposterous notion that he was somehow less deserving than the rest of them.\n\n'Ah, I'm really not the right person for this job,'\n\nActually, he was arguably the worst choice - after all, Sunny had never been great at dealing with people. He was so atrocious at it, in fact, that he had even ended up living alone in seclusion and slowly losing his mind multiple times in his life.\n\nBut at the same time, he was also the best choice.\n\nBecause Kai was keenly aware of lies and insincerity, while Sunny never lied.\n\nKai glanced at him with a peculiar expression for a while.\n\nEventually, he asked in a cautious tone:\n\n'Sunny… you think that I'm dashing?'\n\nSunny blinked a few times.\n\n'T - that… that is your main takeaway?!'\n\nHe exhaled slowly through gritted teeth.\n\n'Bastard, are you fishing for compliments now? Sure, yes, I do think that. Your style is impeccable, and your face is a weapon of mass destruction. Happy now?!'\n\nKai smiled radiantly.\n\n'Why, thank you! It really means a lot, coming from the owner of the Eye Candy Ca…'\n\n'Shut up!'\n\nSunny huffed and pointed to the map of Ariel's Game.\n\n'Strategy! Remember?'\n\nKai kept smiling for a few seconds, then turned to the grid drawn in the ash. A quiet sigh escaped from his lips.\n\n'We really don't know much about how this game works, but generally… the mountain we are occupying is the Castle, which suggests some kind of defensive advantage. Common logic dictates that we should make use of these fortifications to repel the adversary, but actually, such a strategy will simply become our death. Since the adversary forces are so overwhelming, locking ourselves into a defensive strategy will merely postpone our defeat.'\n\nSunny nodded.\n\nKai was, without a doubt, right on that account."

    "content": "2318 A New Paradigm\n\nTrying to defend the Ash Castle was a losing strategy.\n\nThey could potentially deal with the three Snow Beasts, but that would take time. And in that time, more powerful figures would most likely reach the Ash Castle, leading to a checkmate.\n\nSunny had grown used to dealing with problems by using overwhelming strength as of late. But here in Ariel's game, he was once again weak - he did not have his shades, his Shadows, his Memories. He did not even have a single shadow to augment himself.\n\nIf a couple of Demons of a high enough Rank shоwed up, surrounded by Monsters and Beasts, his end would be swift and inevitable. In order to survive, Sunny had to act with cunning and foresight.\n\nHe narrowed his eyes and asked Kai calmly:\n\n'So, what should we do?'\n\nKai shrugged.\n\n'The same thing Ki Song did at Greater Crossing, I guess. Abandon the fortified position and attack instead, aiming to crush the adversary forces while they are isolated from each other.' He glanced at Sunny with curiosity and asked:\n\n'Am I correct?'\n\nSunny remained silent for a few seconds. 'You are not exactly wrong, but you are also not exactly right either.' He sighed and pointed to where Slayer's arrow was sticking from the ash. 'Slayer seems to understand the essence of this conflict better. You see, Kai, your answer is based on sound military paradigm, but it is an obsolete military paradigm - one formed by thousands of years of war and conflict in the waking world. The reality of our world has changed, though… but our thinking has not been quick enough to adapt.' He pointed to the grid. 'I hear that chess is a game that is supposed to represent a military conflict - a mundane military conflict. Death Game, however, is a game that represents a supernatural military conflict, one where Demons and Devils play the role of soldiers. And naturally, there is a Tyrant.'\n\nThis time, Sunny pointed to himself. 'In a mundane war, destroying the adversary army is a primary goal - after all, it is tantamount to victory. But in a world infected by the Nightmare Spell, an individual can possess greater power than an army. The army is merely a tool that the Tyrant uses. It exists for convenience. Therefore, the primary goal is to destroy the Tyrant.'\n\nSunny glanced at the runes describing the three Snow Beasts. 'In other words, your very premise is wrong - because you see the act of destrоying the adversary forces as inherently valuable. But in fact, it is not. It is only valuable if killing them brings us closer to slaying the Snow Tyrant, and if it doesn't, then there's no point in fighting with them at all.' He smiled. 'Which is not to say that killing them is entirely useless. It's just… of minor importance. Or it would have been, if not for one detail - a detail that makes killing these Beasts actually detrimental to us.'\n\nKai raised an eyebrow. 'I can somewhat follow your logic in that fighting the Snow Abominations might not have any value for our current situation. But… detrimental? Surely, removing them from the board will at least give us more breathing room. Plus, no matter how powerful the Snow Tyrant is, the Snow Tyrant surrounded by the Snow Army would still be more powerful.'\n\nSunny nodded. 'Sure. But you are forgetting the initial point Slayer made.'\n\nHe gestured to the rune the silent Shadow had drawn in the ash. 'Sacrifice. There is actually a way to kill the Snow Abominations that will make us stronger. Because of that, killing them in any other way will actually be no different from depriving ourselves of power - power we desperately need to kill the Snow Tyrant.'\n\nNext, he pointed to the squares on the edges of the grid where the Shrines usually stood. One was defended by several Snow figures, while the other one was empty. 'Killing our enemies at first opportunity holds close to no value. In fact, it holds negative value. Just because we can slay them does not mean we should… unless we slay them in one of these Shrines. Do you understand now?'\n\nKai remained silent for a long time, thinking.\n\nEventually, he asked in a subdued tone:\n\n'Are you sure you're nоt a great chess player, Sunny?'\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n'What are you talking about? This has nothing to do with chess. It's just common logic.'\n\nKai gave him a dubious look.\n\n'I wouldn't call such logic common, though.'\n\nThen, he turned and glanced at Slayer with curiosity. 'It is also impressive that your… employee… was able to not only fathom the essence of this game, but also explain it by writing a single rune аnd plunging her arrow into the ash. She is quite eloquent.'\n\nSunny could not help but laugh. Actually, he almost toppled over from laughter.\n\n'Oh? Do you admire her now? I see you have a type… my employees,' He grinned. 'Be careful, though. This one is a real heartbrеaker. Actually, that's how we met.'\n\nKai looked at him in confusion.\n\n'She… broke your heart?'\n\nSunny nodded energetically.\n\n'Exactly! Well, to be precise, she put an arrow through my heart. Hurt like hell.'\n\nTurning to Slayer, Sunny smiled pleasantly.\n\n'But don't worry. The next time we met, we tussled inside a dead god… who was walking around inside the corpse of another, greater dead god… and when the dead god crumbled, I returned the favor. By killing her. Oh, and after I killed her, we fought for about another year, this time inside my own soul. I even died myself in the meantime. Quite a rigorous selection process, as you can see! But how else can one find good employees?'\n\nKai stared at him blankly.\n\nMeeting his hollow gaze, Sunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n'What? Do you use a different recruitment method for the Nightsingers?'\n\nKai closed his eyes for a moment and asked, his voice devoid of all emotions:\n\n'Sunny, can I ask you something?'\n\nSunny blinked a couple of times.\n\n'Sure. You can.'\n\nKai inhaled deeply.\n\n'Do you possibly suffer from some kind of mental illness?'\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n'What? Of course not.'\n\nWhen Kai exhaled slowly, he added with a smile:\n\n'Suffering from mental illnesses? How trite. If anything, mental illnesses suffer from me…'\n\nKai's eyes trembled."

    "title": "2319 Educational Trip.docx",
    "content": "2319 Educational Trip\n\nLooking at Kai, Sunny felt a profound sense of amusement. However, that amusement came and went swiftly.\n\nLetting out a sigh, he glanced up. The firmament of the miniature realm was obscured by the clouds of ash, but it was clear above the snowy peaks. It seemed like the moon was descending… the night would be over soon, making way for the radiance of the day. Somehow, Sunny felt that this short moment of peace was not going to last much longer thаn the night.\n\n'What will the Snow Tyrant do?'\n\nAnd what could the Snow Tyrant do?\n\nActually, Sunny was aware of the subtle strangeness of his situation. He had assumed the place of the Ash Tyrant… who was a figure of vital importance, no doubt, but merely a figure nonetheless.\n\nSunny was not the player.\n\nHis suspicion that there was a distinction between the two was based on a couple of facts. First of all, if the players of Ariel's Game were supposed to act as Tyrants оf their respective Domains… then there would be no Snow Tyrant anywhere in this artificial woгld - after all, the original players of the game were long gone. Secondly, his status as the Ash Tyrant had not granted Sunny any new powers - including the power to control lesser Ash figures. Kai and Slayer were not compelled to obey him because of the nature of the game, they simply listened to him because he was Sunny.\n\nSimilarly…\n\nIf there was a Snow Tyrant on the opposite end of the board, would they have any cоntrol over the Snow Abominations?\n\nHe was not sure. Depending on the answer, though, Sunny was facing two entirely different perils.\n\nIf the Snow Tyrant could control the figures freely, then he would be facing a coordinated and lethal force. This game would be a battle of two minds. If not… the Beasts would roam free, and the main obstacle standing in his way would be this artificial realm itself.\n\n'We'll see soon.'\n\nKai raised an eyebrow.\n\n'What?'\n\nSunny let out another sigh.\n\n'We'll see what kind of battle this is once the Snow Abominations start to move.'\n\nHe glanced at the three snowy peaks.\n\n'If they are mere Beasts, they'll rush to devour us straight away. If they are minions of a Tyrant, though… they'll conquer the other two volcanoes first, to enhance the Snow Domain and weaken the Ash Domain as much as possible before the final siege. Our response will differ drastically depending on what they'll do.'\n\nHe created a needle out of shadows and went about finishing a quiver for Kai. Less than a minute later, it was done.\n\nSunny placed the arrows he had crafted into the quiver and offered it to the charming archer with a smile.\n\n'Here… this will do for now.'\n\nStanding up, Sunny brushed the ash off his clothes and pointed to the pillar of smoke rising into the sky behind them.\n\n'We should probably explore the castle while we can.'\n\nAs they descended into the crater, Sunny glanced at Kai, and then asked calmly:\n\n'You have some experience fighting Great Nightmare Crеatures, yes?'\n\nKai nodded.\n\n'Yes. As a government Saint, during the war in Bastion, and later as the steward of Ravenheart… I've faced a few.'\n\nSunny smiled darkly.\n\n'How was it?'\n\nKai's expression grew concerned.\n\n'Like fighting gods.'\n\nHe remained silent for a few seconds, then added with a sigh:\n\n'The Great Ones… are stronger and more fearsome than abominations of lesser Ranks, true. But I've long grown used to fighting against enemies who are superior to me in all regards. The problem is that facing them feels different from a normal battle. It is as if the world itself is on their side.'\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n'The world is indeed on their side - because they force the world to be on their side. What separates those Great and Supreme from those of lesser Ranks is the quality of our will. Our will is tyrannical enough to subjugate the world… to some degree, at least. Well, you must know all that already - after all, both Nephis and I spent quite a lot of time sharing our experience with Cassie, who then compiled a report for those who need to know.'\n\nKai glanced at Sunny with a distant expression.\n\n'Yes, I know. However, I am sorry to say this, Sunny, but I don't think that anyone else will be able to repeat what you two have done - attaining Supremacy naturally, I mean. That… that is not my self - doubt talking. It's just that you and Nephis often underestimate how exceptional you are. Underestimating it woefully.'\n\nSunny pursed his lips. Kai, meanwhile, let out a sigh.\n\n'Which means that the rest of us will have to do it the usual way. We will have to challenge the Fourth Nightmare.'\n\nSunny studied him for a while, then looked away.\n\n'Only four people have ever survived the Fourth Nightmare. You will face Great Nightmare Creatures there, too… so, think of this little excursion of ours as a practice run. I'll handle the Cursed Ones, if we have to face any, but the Great abominations will be on you. I'm sure you'll manage - after all, I…'\n\nSunny wanted to mention how he had killed a Great Devil as a Sleeper, but held himself back for once. Now was not time for jokes.\n\n'I'll have your back. You have two perfect teachers with you, anyway. I am a Supreme myself, while she…'\n\nHe pointed to Slayer.\n\n'She is probably the most prolific killer I have ever met. Not only that, but her main killing tool is a bow, as well. So watch her carefully, and learn from her.'\n\nThere was really no better role model for Kai than Slayer. So, Sunny had high hopes for him. Having two exceptional archers assisting him against the Snow Nightmare Creature sounded like a dream, too - he was rarely pampered by having such support.\n\nKai smiled.\n\n'I will.'\n\nSunny hesitated for a few seconds, thinking what else to say. It was not a matter of motivating Kai to do his best - he had never lacked motivation. It was more of a matter of showing him a perspective that would make him want to do more than his best. To have the will to succeed no matter what.\n\nThis was the only way to survive in the ruthless world of the Nightmare Spell.\n\nEventually, Sunny asked:\n\n'Your Nightmares. How did you survive them?'\n\nKai contemplated his question for a while, then answered with a faint smile:\n\n'I survived because of the people who were by my side.'\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n'Indeed. Because no one survives in the Dream Realm alone.'\n\nHe glanced at Kai and added evenly:\n\n'But to those people, you were and will be the person by their side. Their survival will depend on you, just like your survival will depend on theirs.'\n\nKai's expression changed subtly, and his smile disappeared.\n\nWitnessing that change, Sunny looked away.\n\n'So, how many more people will survive the Fourth Nightmare in the future is up to you. Take responsibility.'\n\nKai remained silent for a long time, then nodded silently. By then, they had reached the crumbling castle."

    "title": "2320 Ash Castle.docx",
    "content": "2320 Ash Castle\n\nThe Ash Castle was a strange and towering structure. It was built above the main vent of the volcano, seemingly hovering in the air. At first glance, it seemed as if its immense weight was supported by nothing except the rising torrents of smoke… but at a closer glance, Sunny saw enormous chains biting into the dark rock of the crater, covered in thick layers of soot.\nThe castle was hanging above the abyss, the smoke - filled emptiness serving as its moat.\nThe defensive value of such a structure was questionable, to say the least. Sure, any attacker would plummet into the fiery depths of the volcano unless they found a way to breach the wide chasm, but at the same time, the defenders would find it difficult to prevent the enemy from destroying the anchors of the chains that held the castle in the air.\n\nExtending his shadow sense into the abyssal vent, Sunny sensed more chains fastening the castle to its walls further down. There seemed to be some kind of mechanism built into the obsidian plate that served as the foundation for the charred fortress, now broken and in a state of disrepair.\n'Was this castle able to descend into the depths of the volcano once?\n\nEven if it had been, it was stuck in place now, barely able to support its own weight.\nSunny imagined the whole structure plummeting into the smoke under their feet. That would be troublesome… but not too troublesome. After all, he could fly away аt any moment.\n\nThe drawbridge of the castle was raised, so Sunny manifested two raven - black wings and offered Slayer a hand. She glanced at it chillingly, while Kai smiled.\n\n'I see you are a gentleman…'\n\nAs Slayer took his hand, Sunny strained his muscles and tossed her into the air. The nimble Shadow shot over the chasm like a bullet, disappearing into the smoke - a few seconds later, she landed on one of the crumbling towers of the castle, twirled to regain her balance, and summoned her bow in one graceful motion.\nHer skirt flared, and by the time its hem fell to rest on her smooth ebony thigh once again, an arrow was already nocked on the string of the black bow.\nKai watched all of that happen in silence. Sunny was blinded by the smoke, but could sense the shadows - the charming archer, however, could see everything transpire just fine.\n\nHe sighed.\n'Never mind.'\n\nSunny smiled.\n'What, did you expect me to give her a ride? Thanks, but no thanks. The last time she mounted me was too memorable.'\nHe paused for a moment, and then added in a glum tone:\n\n'I mean, she cut off my wings, strangled me, and almost drove a knife into my skull.'\n\nKai blinked a couple of times.\n\n'She did?'\n\nWhen Sunny nodded, he gave him a reproachful look.\n'You know… something like that would have been good to know before I carried her across the sea of clouds on my back.'\n\nSunny grinned.\n\n'I did cross my mind to give you a warning. But I was sure that she would not try to kill you… well, mostly sure. Reasonably sure? I was somewhat sure that she would not try to kill you.'\n\nWith that, he jumped into the chasm, spread his wings, and allowed the currents of heated air to carry him across the abyssal moat of the Ash Castle. Kai followed a few seconds later with a quiet sigh.\nIf there had been something perilous waiting for them inside, Slayer would have already turned it into a pincushion with her arrows. So, the two of them landed calmly on the cracked floor of the castle's vast courtyard, then walked toward the crumbling keep.\nSlayer allowed her bow to turn into a slender chain vambrace, then climbed down the tower with lethal grace. She seemed to plummet from one support to another, wedging her short swords between the weathered stones when there was none to find purchase on - in just a few short moments, she reached the ground and joined them.\n\nWhen they entered the keep, Sunny glanced around with a surprised expression.\n'Huh.'\nWhat looked like a castle from the outside was actually merely a crude model of one. There was nothing inside, really - no floors, no chambers, no complicated maze of corridors and stairwells. Instead, there was simply a vast empty space, the floor covered in ash that piled like mountains in the corners.\n\nIt seemed that even Ariel's attention to detail had a limit.\n'Well, it makes sense.'\nAfter all, the Ash Tyrants that had populated this castle once would not have been humans. Their size would have varied greatly, too - the towering gate of the keep hinted that some of them were truly enormous.\n'Do you see anything under the ash?'\n\nSunny did not know what he wanted to find, exactly, but he had hoped to discover some clues about Ariel, his game, and the Jade Queen.\nKai shook his head slowly.\n'It's all in ruins. But there is some kind of pedestal in the center.'\n\nThey looked at each other, then made their way to the heart of the empty keep.\nThere, the floor of the castle opened into a great circular pit. Smoke rose through the opening like a rugged pillar, escaping through a similar one in the roof of the Ash Castle.\nAnd just in front of the pit, there was a charred stone pedestal that resembled an altar, its surface covered in ash.\n\nWalking closer, Sunny hesitated for a few seconds, then brushed the ash away. His hand felt two small shapes hidden beneath it - clearing more of the ash, Sunny picked one of them up and studied it impassively.\nThere, in his palm, lay a bestial figurine cut from flawless white jade.\n\nIt was the figure of a Snow Beast.\n'Two of them…'\n\nTwelve of the fourteen Snow figures remained on the board, which meant that the player of the Ash Domain had managed to slay two - two Beasts.\n\nAnd here, two Snow Beast figurines were resting on an altar.\nThat… could not have been a coincidence.\n'Why do you think these figures are here?'\n\nKai's question made Sunny frown.\n\nHe remained silent for a few seconds, then shrugged.\n'I'm not entirely sure.'\n\nThen, he suddenly remembered something… the ancient bones resting in the depths of the Ravenheart volcano.\nFollowing an impulse, Sunny shifted his weight a little and tossed the figure of the Snow Beast into the pit.\n\nIt disappeared into the smoke without a trace.\n\nA dozen seconds passed in silence, and then…\n\nSunny was suddenly somewhere else."

    "title": "2321 Truth or Death.docx",
    "content": "2321 Truth or Death\n\nThe world was coming to an end.\n\nOn an endless white plain, the corpses of lesser gods lay broken and shattered. Rivers of ichor were flowing across the fractured ice like molten gold, cascading into the depths of an imprisoned ocеan. High above, the sky was broken as well. Tendrils of nothingness were seeping through the fissures, slowly consuming the vast expanse of the firmament.\n\nA giant was kneeling in the middle of the silent battlefield, grasping his head with two enormous hands. Golden blood and viscous streams of grey matter were flowing through his fingers, and his radiant eyes were darting around, feverish and dazed.\n\nHis gorgeous ivory armor was torn, and his spear lay on the ice, forgotten, still brimming with the echoes of destructive lightning.\n\nThe giant was a deity, his spirit as vast as a world.\n\nHis lips moved, whispering:\n\n'I… I am… I am, I am… I am…'\n\nHis whispers were full of dread.\n\nThen, he suddenly grew still and glanced down, at the empty vastness of the broken ice in front of him.\n\nThe giant's expression slowly grew eerily calm, and his voice grew even, sounding deeper and lower than it had before.\n\nHe lowered his hands, allowing his broken skull to come undone, and spoke:\n\n'Hail Weaver… Firstborn of the Forgotten God.'\n\nAs he did, a nebulous figure was suddenly revealed on the ice, shrouded by a tattered mantle and wearing a fearsome mask. A voice that was like a thousand hopeless prayers resounded from behind the mask, making the giant shiver.\n\n'Brother, my brother. Why are you hiding inside this hideous corpse?'\n\nThe giant laughed with a voice that was not his own, then spoke in an insidious whisper:\n\n'Ah… must you offend me so, Weaver? Must you abandon all fear when facing the Demon of Dread? All of us daemons have sworn to destroy you. Why are you here? Why have you revealed yourself?'\n\nThe fearsome mask of the nebulous daemon stayed still.\n\nWeaver remained silent for a while, then spoke:\n\n'My brother knows what everyone fears, and therefore, he knows everyone's truth. However, I know no fear. What then is my truth?'\n\nThe wind moved the tattered mantle, revealing nothing of what was hidden beneath.\n\n'I thought I'd offer you to play a game.'\n\nThe dying giant gazed upon him, light dimming slowly in his golden eyes.\n\n'A game? Ah… what kind of game?'\n\nThe Demon of Fate responded to the dуing deity:\n\n'A game of death, naturally. Whoever wins will give the other one a truth. And if I lose, I will allow myself to be destroyed.'\n\nThe giant shuddered and collapsed, and as he did, the broken ice swallowed his corpse.\n\nA faint whisper drifted above the harrowing battlefield:\n\n'Come… I accept…'\n\nThe world suddenly disappeared into nothingness, replaced by a familiar room.\n\nA masked figure was sitting on the cushions in front of an exquisite jade board. The room was drowning in darkness, and from that darkness, a whisper came:\n\n'I know what truth I seek. But what truth can you, who sees the depths of fate, be lacking? What is it that you wish to learn, Weaver?'\n\nThe fearsome mask of the Demon of Fate glanced at the darkness. A thousand intertwined voices resounded from below it, making the darkness tremble.\n\n'Do you know how fate can be broken, brother?'\n\nA porcelain hand rose from the depths of the tattered mantle and grasped the figure of a figure carved from white jade.\n\n'That is what I wish to learn.'\n\n***\n\nSunny let out a groan and collapsed to his knees.\n\n'Ah…'\n\nThe echo of the insidious whisper and the aftershock of the nebulous voice were still ringing in his ears. He shuddered, feeling a terrible pressure crushing his mind.\n\n'Sunny?'\n\nKai was startled, rushing to support him.\n\nSunny waved him away.\n\n'I am… I am fine.'\n\nHe was, indeed, fine - if a little worse to wear.\n\n'What happened?'\n\nSunny slowly picked himself off the floor and glanced at the remaining jade figure on the altar.\n\n'Hell if I know.'\n\nHis voice sounded subdued.\n\nOne moment, he was standing in the keep of the Ash Castle, and the next moment, he was in the middle of a distressing battlefield, the world coming undone around him, witnessing two daemons having a peculiar conversation.\n\nWeaver and Ariel… Fate and Dread.\n\nThe master of lies and the keeper of truths.\n\nWeaver's nebulous figure seemed to be a bit ragged, for a lofty Divinity. The conversation must have taken place during the Doom War, when the sinister daemon was being hunted both by their siblings and by the gods. That porcelain hand looked familiar, as well… it must have been the one Weaver had assembled from the parts of the broken mannequins in the Ebony Tower.\n\nAriel, meanwhile, seemed to have been possessing the body of a defeated Divine champion - the giant who wielded a spear infused with ferocious endlessness of golden lightning. Sunny had not seen what the Demon of Dread actually looked like until the very end… possibly Ariel did not look like anything, at all.\n\nMaybe the Demon of Dread existed only as a whisper.\n\nIn any case, Weaver had offered to play a game with high stakes, and Ariel accepted.\n\n'I think… I just saw a vision. Of sorts.'\n\nWhat Sunny had seen did not feel like a vision. Actually, it did not feel like anything he was familiar with. It was as if he was there, but not there. As if he was present, but also absent.\n\nAs if he had simply learned the truth of what had happened on that day.\n\nSunny winced, feeling the pressure of witnessing three gods - two daemons and a dying Divine human - subside slowly, allowing him to breathe freely once more.\n\n'Who was that giant?'\n\nKai, meanwhile, raised an eyebrow.\n\n'Uh… are you prone to receiving visions, Sunny?'\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n'No. Rather, it seems like throwing the figure of the Snow Beast into the volcano triggered it.'\n\nHe hesitated for a while.\n\n'In any case, I think I was wrong.'\n\nKai frowned.\n\n'About what?'\n\nLooking around, Sunny remembered the jade board and the desperate position of the Ash Domain. The Ash was losing desperately.\n\nHe inhaled deeply.\n\n'I don't think that the Jade Queen played Ash.'\n\nSunny looked at the figure of the Snow Beast once more and said, his voice subdued:\n\n'I think the Demon of Dread played Ash. As for Snow… it must have been played by Weaver.'"

    "content": "2322 Beast Sacrifice\n\nSunny considered the peculiar vision he had received for a while. Eventually, his eyes gleamed darkly.\n\n'They were playing for truths.'\n\nAriel had been a collector of truth, but one mystery he could never solve was Weaver. Weaver, meanwhile… seemed to have been interested in finding a way to change fate.\n\nThat truth alone was priceless. Sunny had suspected that the Demon of Fate had a complicated relationship with their own… source element? Domain? Aspect? In any case, the Nightmare Spell seemed to have been designed with the explicit purpose of training its carriers to defy and twist fate.\n\nSunny firmly believed that the appraisal the Spell gave to those who conquered Nightmares was connected to how much they strayed from the original flow of fate, at least. But having a strong suspicion and hearing it with his own two ears were two different things. Granted… Sunny only learned that Weaver was searching for a way to change fate, not why. He did not know what the Demon of Fate had discovered, either.\n\nIn any case, the two daemons had played Death Game - the winner was supposed to be rewarded with a truth. And Weaver had utterly crushed Ariel, in the end.\n\n'Rewarded, huh?' Was that what had happened to him? He had sacrificed the figure of a slain figure… and received a truth as a reward.\n\nBut why that truth, in particular?\n\nSunny stared at the remaining Snow Beast figure, then at the pit opening into the main vent of the volcano.\n\n'Wait,' Was it simply because he wondered who the players of this game had been? 'My head was full of questions, though. Why this one in particular?' Was the answer given at random, or did the strength of a sacrificed figure play a role?\n\nWould he learn something far more important if he sacrificed a Snow Monster figure? A Demon, A Devil…\n\nA Tyrant?\n\nSuddenly, Sunny was very glad that there were twelve whole Snow Abominations left on the board. He had many questions.\n\nSunny had spent a decade slowly learning the secrets of the world. By now, he knew more about the truth of existence than almost anyone… but he still desperately wanted - needed - to know more. Why had the Doom War started? How did it end? How did the gods die? How did daemons perish? Was the Forgotten God still imprisoned in the Void? Where had the Nightmares and the Dream Realm come from?\n\nWhat had been Weaver's goal? Why was the Nightmare Spell created? To what еnd? And countless less grandiose quеstions, as well… For example, what did he need to do to kill Eurys? What lay at the heart of Shadow Realm? When had the Demon of Oblivion died? How could she have been dead before Nether and his siblings rebelled against the gods?\n\n'I think…'\n\nA strange smile slowly bloomed on Sunny's face.\n\n'I think that coming here may have been the best idea of my life, Kai.'\n\nTwelve Snow Abominations, and the Snow Beast figure in front of him…\n\nSunny had just discovered a way to pry thirteen truths from Ariel's Game.\n\nKai gave him a peculiar look.\n\n'Sunny, can you please snap out of it? You're scaring, uh… your elegant Shadow over there. Yeah.'\n\nSunny blinked a couple of times and glanced at Slayer. Slayer seemed perfectly at ease. Kai, however, looked a little nervous. Sunny chuckled.\n\n'Alright, alright. It's just that I discovered a use for the figures of slain Snow Abominations. I'm a little excited.'\n\nWhat answer would he receive next?\n\nSunny reached for the remaining Snow figure, but then halted.\n\nHis expression turned guarded.\n\n'Am I… letting my curiosity trump caution?'\n\nThey had just recently talked about how some truths were too dangerous to learn. Sunny did not need to think too much to remember a dreadful example… they were the runes containing the knowledge of the Void that Ariel had left behind in the Estuary of the Great River.\n\nThe closer one's soul was to being Divine, the more resistant it was to the corrupting influence of the Void. That was why Awakening could destroy the Seed of Nightmare blooming in an Aspirant's soul… that was also why Sunny could endure knowing more about the Void as a Supreme as he could as a Master or a Saint. But that did not mean that he could endure much of such knowledge… not at all. And he definitely could not endure what Weaver and Ariel could. Even they had not been entirely immune to Corruption, so what hope did Sunny have?\n\nIf Ariel's Game granted him a truth that he could not endure, what was he going to do?\n\nSunny hesitated for a while.\n\n'Wait. Isn't it wonderful, though?'\n\nThis incarnation of his was currently separated from the other six. Their minds and memories would fuse once again after Sunny escaped Ariel's Game… but not before it. So even if his mind was infected by Corruption as a result of learning something he was not supposed to know, he could simply kill himself. That way, his other incarnations would never come in contact with the forbidden knowledge.\n\nKai frowned a little.\n\n'What… are you thinking about?'\n\nSunny shrugged absentmindedly.\n\n'Killing myself…'\n\nKai was suddenly standing very near, looking at him intensely.\n\n'No, you mustn't!'\n\nSunny glanced at him in confusion.\n\n'Huh?'\n\nKai grabbed his shoulders, a rattled expression on his face.\n\n'You… we don't know each other that well, and I won't presume to know what scars lay hidden in your heart… but you must not, Sunny! In this world we live in, a human life can be lost in an instant. But that only makes it more precious - just like your life is precious, too…'\n\nSunny scowled.\n\n'What are you on about, fool?'\n\nThen, realizing how his words must have sounded to Kai, who could feel their sincerity, he winced.\n\n'Oh, you misunderstood. I wasn't really thinking about killing myself… just this version of myself, should the need arise. It's not that big of an issue. Plus, this wouldn't even be the first or second time I killed myself. As you can see, I'm still perfectly alive!'\n\nKai stared at him silently for a while, then slowly let go of his shoulders, turned away, and coughed a couple of times.\n\n'Oh. Oh, I see. Never mind, then.'\n\nThen, his expression turned cold and wary, full of concerned apprehension.\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n'This guy… such a handful, really!'\n\n'Listen, why would I kill myself? I am filthy rich, drop-dead gorgeous, have an awesome castle, and my girlfriend is literally the most gorgeous woman in the world. Who would want to die аnd leave all that behind?'\n\nKai glanced at him and shook his head.\n\n'No, it's not that. I just looked beyond the castlе.'\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n'And?'\n\nA dark expression appeared on Kai's face.\n\n'Dо you remember saying that we'll have to wait for the adversary to make the first move? Well…'\n\nHe sighed.\n\n'I think they're making the move now…'"

    "title": "2323 Golden Dawn.docx",
    "content": "2323 Golden Dawn\nA second later, Sunny was standing on the edge of the volcano's vast caldera. He had stepped through the shadows while pulling Slayer and Kai with him - Slayer remained impassive, long used to such treatment, while Kai sеemed a little startled. Sunny remained silent for a moment.\n\n'Come to think of it… that castle is a really awful fortress, isn't it?'\nThe Ash Castle stood above the main vent of the volcano, at the very heart of the caldera - which meant that its walls and towers were lower than the surrounding slopes. One could not see the snowy peaks even from the roof of donjon, while the adversary would be above the castle as soon as they scaled the volcano and reached the caldera. It was a truly terribly designed defensive fortification…\n\n'With respect… I don't think now is the proper time to ponder the merits and flaws of an old castle's design.'\nKai's voice sounded tense. Sunny glanced at him and raised an eyebrow.\n'What do you mean? We are about to be attacked, so when would there be а better time?' Smiling faintly, he turned to face the three snowy peaks towering in the distance.\n\nThe moon had fallen beyond the horizon, and the sun was rising. Now that Sunny knew where east was, he could determine where the rest of the cardinal directions were, as well. The Ash Castle stood on the southern edge of the game board, while the three lonеsome mountains - and the Snow Castle as well - were in the north.\nDawn had painted the sea of clouds below in soft shades of mauve and lilac. The world was darker above the volcanoes, where clouds of smoke and ash obscured the sky, but in the north… Sunny frowned.\nHurricane winds were blowing above the distant mountains, and a vast snowstorm was rolling from the north, its billowing wall slowly devouring the world. A few moments later, it crashed into the three peaks, sending great plumes of snow into the air. Infused with a dreamy radiance by the golden dawn, the plumes of snow extended south, carried by the wind like streaming tendrils.\n\n'There is something peculiar about the wind.'\nSunny looked at Kai.\n'How do you mean?'\nThe charming archer hesitated for a few moments, then shrugged.\n'I'm not sure how to descгibe it. Awakened archers always pay attention to the wind - the speed and direction of the wind matter a lot when making long - distance shorts, after all, so it becomes an instinct. And my instinct is telling me that there is something wrong with the wind.'\nHe hesitated for a few moments, and then added with a sigh:\n'Actually, we tend to rely on instinct a lot. Many things affect the flight of an arrow - altitude, temperature, humidity, even the Coriolis effect… anything that has to do with ballistics. Naturally, none of them behave reasonably in the Dream Realm, so there is no other choice than to develop an instinctual sense of all those things. If you want to hit a target from a great distance, that is.'\nSunny scratched the tip of his nose.\n'Really? Huh… I just sort of toss things with as much force as I can and hope for the best. Well, I don't rely on sight to aim, so I guess my situation is a bit different.' Then, he looked at Slayer and smiled.\n'What about you? Are you a walking encyclopedia of ballistics, as well?'\nInstead of answering, his Shadow pointed to the tendrils of snow extending from the lonesome mountains.\n\nAt that moment, the first snowflakes had reached the slopes of the fuming volcano. Then something peculiar happened… The snowstorm swallowed three mountains, and at the same time, the tendrils of snow glistened, seemingly absorbing the golden light of dawn. A ripple spread through the sea of clouds below, and the snow seemed to solidify, turning into glass. Soon, unimaginable, ethereal bridges of frozen glass arched above the vibrant sea of golden - pink clouds, spanning dozens of kilometers as they glistened with dreamy light. It was a gorgeous and fantastical view…\nWhat mattered the most to Sunny, though, was that the crystal bridges were connecting the snowy mountains to the volcanoes.\n\n'Are they making a move?'\nHe scrunched his face faintly, then looked at Kai and Slayer.\n'I think you guys should prepare to shoot.'\nHe could barely see the distant mountains behind the billowing veil of snow that swallowed them. However, he could feel it… A heavy and oppressive feeling that permeated the air, screaming of a looming threat.\nKai shivered, prompting Sunny to ask:\n'What do you see?'\nThe charming archer hesitated for a few moments, then spoke quietly:\n'On the eastern mountain… the clockwork giant is coming to life. Ice is falling from his joints, and he is reaching for an enormous sword that was thrust into the snow. On the western mountain, the huge worm is slowly unfurling its long body. It's slithering through a tunnel - its head is, at least. That thing is even more enormous than I thought.'\nHis gaze shifted a little.\n'And on the mountain right in front of us, the hive of the crystalline insects is in a frenzy. They have already awakened from their slumber and are rushing outside, clеaring the entrances of the ice caves from the snow and ice that had blocked them. There are… much more of them than it seemed.'\n\nSunny frowned.\nEach of the mountains was connected to one of the volcanoes. So, it was reasonable to assume that the clockwork giant would conquer the eastern volcano, the snow worm would conquer the western volcano… While the crystalline hive would attack the Ash Castle.\nHe had expected the Snow Abominations to either go for the empty squares or attack the castle together. But it seemed that they were going to act independently, going for both targets.\n'So, what does it say to me?'\nHe had no idea.\nWhat Sunny did know at the second was that a swarm of Great Beasts would soon descend upon him and his companions.\nHe gave Kai a long look, then outstretched a hand…\nNothing happened.\n'Damn it.'\nSunny had wanted to summon the Shadow Chair, but alas, he had no access to his Memories.\nSo, instead, he brushed the ash from a nearby boulder, sat down, and gestured at the ethereal glass bridge.\nNoticing a confused expression on Kai's face, Sunny smiled.\n'They're all yours!'"

    "title": "2324 Enemy Move.docx",
    "content": "2324 Enemy Move\n\nSunny wanted to see how Kai would fare in a battle against Great abominations. The crystalline insects seemed like good practice… naturally, there was a possibility that the entire hive consisted of Cursed Ones, instead. But if thаt was true, the three of them were already dead. There was nothing much to do.\n\nKai stared at Sunny with a stunned expression. 'You're… really not going to do anything?'\n\nSunny smiled pleasantly. 'How can you say that, buddy? I'll do plenty, naturally… enjoy the view, relax, appreciate the weather. Oh, I'll craft new arrows while you waste the ones I already made, too. So make every shot count.'\n\nKai kept looking at him for a few more seconds, then turned to look at Slayer. He did not say anything, but his expression was quite telling. It was as if Kai wanted to ask… 'That's what you're dealing with on a daily basis?' Slayer spared him a short look and shrugged.\n\nSunny, meanwhile, leaned back and closed his eyes. 'Let me tell you, Saint Nightingale… my previous disciple set quite a high bar. Ah, she was such a joy to train. What other teacher can boast that their student earned a True Name before even becoming an Aspirant? So, no pressure, but please don't disappoint me. I have high standards because of her!'\n\nKai sighed and nocked an arrow on the string of his bow. 'She is my student, as well.' Sunny blinked a couple of times. 'Huh?' Kai smiled faintly. 'A girl who earned a True Name before becoming an Aspirant… you mean Rain, right? The only person in the world who Awakened without the Nightmare Spell. I was her archery tutor for a short while back in NQSC, numеrous years ago. I think Effie introduced us. Small world, huh?'\n\nSunny cleared his throat. 'Right,' 'Oh… I see. I think she mentioned knowing you.' 'I was the one who convinced you to give her lessons, fool!' Naturally, Kai did not remember that. He took a deep breath, raised his bow, and slowly drew it. Then, he spoke evenly: 'Strike true.' His clear voice was not loud, but it somehow managed to drown out the howling wind. The stalwart authority contained within it moved the world, making the world listen. Sunny sensed a faint flow of essence, and the arrow he had crafted suddenly seemed much more than it had been before. 'Hmm…'\n\nAs Kai allowed the string to escape his relaxed fingers and sent the arrow flying, Sunny remembered his battle against the Dread Lord. 'Actually, I might have been wrong.'\n\nKai seemed to be plagued by doubt, which did not lend itself well to being a Sovereign. But, on the other hand, the very nature of his Aspect forced him to constantly practice exerting his authority… in a way. A Supreme like Sunny could bend the world to his will. But Kai did not have to… the world simply listened to him, following his commands voluntarily. Was that preparing him for Supremacy, or was it a detriment instead? Sunny was not sure, and he had no time to ponder this issue at the moment, either. What he was sure of, though, was that a giant tentacle would not rise from below the clouds to destroy Kai's arrow - not this time. His certainty was based on the fact that when the tendrils of snow turned into crystal bridges, he was suddenly able to extend his shadow sense forward, to the lonesome peak that was now hiding in the embrace of a snowstorm.\n\nSunny could sense the entire ice hive, now. And what he sensed did not make him happy. 'Oh, they are Great Beasts, all right.' There were about a hundred of them. Each was the size of a bull, with a small thorax and a large abdomen. Their legs were thin and delicate, but frighteningly powerful. The bodies of the insect-like abominations seemed like they were made out of glass, and glancеd deceptively fragile. They were strangely breathtaking…\n\nSunny knew that they would glisten gorgeously in the sunlight. He also knew that once they drew closer, he would see gnawed bones in their transparent bellies… possibly even a human skull or two, Gods only knew what these nightmaгe creatures looked like soon after feasting on the flesh of their enemies. The sight of the bloody paste sloshing inside their crystal stomachs had to be indescribably gruesome… and Sunny hoped to never learn what nectar these creatures produced, and what kind of hives they built when not trapped in a desolate realm made by a daemon.\n\nHad it been Ariel who turned the crystalline insects into a figure, or Weaver? Whoever it was, they had done a great favor for the world by imprisoning these abominations here.\n\nKai's arrow was still flying when Slayer raised heг bow. Sunny saw lean muscles roll under her ebony skin, drawing taut like steel cables, as she pulled the string. Her graceful figure was like a work of art sculpted from smooth obsidian, with every little detail carved with obsessive care. A moment later, she released the string, and a powerful gust sent her long braid fluttering in the wind. Sunny shivered, feeling a cold killing intent wash over him. Reaching into the shadows, he went about crafting another arrow.\n\n'Did you feel that?'\n\nKai responded without looking at him: 'Feel what?'\n\nSunny smiled faintly. 'How utterly focused on one thing and one thing only our killer gorgeousness is… on killing whoever it is that her arrow is aimed at.'\n\nKai frowned.\n\nIn the next moment, his arrow hit the target. It was an amazing shot, really - very few people would be able to hit a moving target from dozens of kilometers away, despite the raging wind. However, it was all for naught. Because Kai's arrow simply bounced off the crystalline insect's gorgeous carapace.\n\nHis expression dimmed. Then, suddenly… Slayer's arrow struck the exact same Nightmare Creature, piercing its gemlike compound eye and making its head explode into a million glistening shards. Sunny pursed his lips and glanced at his Shadow with reproach. 'Listen… with you aiming for the eye, it is hard for me to illustrate the point. Couldn't you have pierced its carapace, instead?'\n\nSlayer gave him a cold, murderous look. Her inky-black eyes were quite expressive, saying… 'How about I pierce your caprice, instead?' Sunny coughed. 'Fine, fine…' He outstretched a hand, but then remembered that he could not summon the Endless Spring either.\n\nSunny sighed. 'What are you guys waiting for? Keep shooting. There's a hundred hungry Great Beasts out there, you know. They'll be here in less than a minute… how numerous do you think you can kill before then?'\n\nNo matter how many it was, he knew that it would not be enough."

    "title": "2325 Crystal Hive.docx",
    "content": "2325 Crystal Hive.\n\nAlthough Sunny insinuated that he was not going to join the battle, in truth, he knew that he would have to. His carefree demeanor was nothing but a facade.\nThe situation was quite bleak.\n\nIn the west, the enormous worm had finally emerged from the billowing wall of snow. Its massive head reached the ethereal glass bridge, and as its pale body rippled, the Cursed Beast speedily crawled across the abyss of gilded clouds. The clouds were painted in vibrant shades of gold and magenta, while the gossamer bridge glistened in the sunlight. The sight of it was as gorgeous as the Snow Worm was grotesque.\n\nIts massive body extended and extended from the snowstorm, already spanning several kilometers in length. And yet, Sunny still could not see its tail. In fact, he had a peculiar feeling that he might not see it at all, as if the Cursed One's body defied the concept of finality.\nAs if the length of the ghastly Nightmare Creature was simply infinite, becoming as great as it needed to be. A Beast like that could probably devour the roots of an entire realm.\n\nAnd yet, Sunny felt far more pressured by the clockwork giant marching across the fantastical bridge of glasslike snow in the east. Now that the creature had drawn closer, he could discern a few details of its appearance. The giant did, indeed, look somewhat similar to the toy knights they had seen in the Jade Palace. However, that similarly was shallow.\n\nThe Nightmare Creature was clearly a construct, its massive body assembled from wood, brass, and weathered hide, shaped to resemble a mighty warrior wearing a suit of heavy armor. Thousands of scars marred its surface, as if the giant had survived a myriad of terrifying battles, as if it had survived every war that had ever been waged, felling myriad enemies with its sword.\nThe giant did not resemble a toy at all, if anything, it resembled a training dummy that had served some warmongering deity before coming alive and subsequently succumbing to Corruption. Maybe it had.\n\nThe giant was marching across the bridge with measured, heavy steps, and even from a great distance, Sunny felt pressured by the unhurried inevitability of its approach. Luckily, the two Cursed Ones were heading for the two volcanoes that Kai and Slayer had abandoned.\n\nThe detestable Ice Hive, however, was heading directly for the Ash Castle.\n\nBy now, the first of the crystalline abominations were already emerging from the vast network of caves they had perforated the mountain with. Their transparent bodies seemed to ignite under the sun, shining with reflected light. The first few were already on the glass bridge - they stopped, shоok the snow and ice of their crystal carapaces and then leaped into the air. Translucent wings unfurled behind them, glowing like golden panes of stained glass.\n\n'Great. So they can fly, too?'\n\nBehind a veneer of nonchalance, Sunny felt concerned. He continued to craft arrows while observing the adversary through the shadows.\n\nAs soon as the first of them rose into the air, its wing shattered, broken by Kai's arrow. The Nightmare Creature plummeted down, doomed to disappear into the sea of clouds - before it could, however, two of its kin swooped in, tearing the struggling beast apart and devouring its crystalline flesh. Sunny frowned.\n\n'Not quick enough.'\n\nKai and Slayer were like a two-man… well, one man and one shadow lady… artillery battery. The amount of devastation two Transcendent archers could unleash was truly frightening. With each shot, hurricane winds rose and ravaged the slopes of the towering volcano, making the ground shake. Roaring thunderclaps tore apart the silence, making Sunny's ears ring.\n\nAnd they were rapid, too. When he imagined what the two of them could have done to the great alloy ramparts of Falcon Scott, he felt a chill run down his spine.\n\nSlayer rapidly killed several abominations, piercing their crystalline bodies without discrimination. Kai, however, had learned his lesson and tried to aim for more vulnerable spots, like the wings or the eyes. He managed to send a few insect-like Beasts plummeting into the clouds, as well - two of them were torn apart by their siblings, while the third landed on the ethereal bridge and scurried across its surface, only to die half a dozen moments later when Slayer's arrow pinned it to the glistening glass.\n\nThinking back to the battle against Asuras of Condemnation, Sunny was surprised by how efficient the two archers were in slaying Great Beasts. And yet, their startling lethality was nowhere near enough to prevent the Ice Hive from reaching the volcano, let alone annihilate it. At best, they would dispose of a couple dozen of the eerily gorgeous crystalline abominations before being forced to engage them in melee.\nAnd once the swarm of Great Beasts descended upon them, they would be overwhelmed in a matter of moments.\n\nSunny had to prevent that from happening. However, even Sunny himself was not sure that he could contend against scores of Great Beasts. Perhaps if he had his shadows with him and could amplify his body, he would have stood a better chance.\n\nAlone as he was, however, Sunny was only marginally stronger than each individual crystal Nightmare Creature. He had some advantages thanks to his Aspect, naturally, but while it was enough to face a dozen or two Great Beasts, fighting the entire hive could easily get him killed.\n\n'Fighting against overwhelming odds, a hair's breadth away from death… ah, how nostalgic…'\n\nSunny's expression crumpled. He would rather not revisit this particular part of his tumultuous past. There had to be some trick, some strategy he could come up with.\n\nThere was about half a minute left before the dwellers of the Ice Hive reached the volcano. Great Beasts could move with startling speed, but Kai and Slayer were aiming for the swiftest ones first - so, the abominations were slower to reach their target than they would have been otherwise.\n\n'I have thirty moments to come up with a plan.'\n\nSunny began to craft another arrow and then rushed forward, grabbed Slayer, and pulled her into the shadows.\n\n'Kai, dodge!'\n\nKai was already in the air by the time Sunny finished the sentence. In the next moment, the slope of the volcano exploded, drowning in vicious white radiance and incinerating heat."

    "title": "2326 Attack and Defense.docx",
    "content": "2326 Attack and Defense\n\nSunny was tossed out of the shadows and rolled across the melting rock, still holding Slayer in his embrace. A moment later, he pushed himself off the ground and carried both of them dozens of meters away, to safety.\n\nKai wаs in the air, embers burning in his auburn hair. The bronze elements of his ivory armor had turned radiant on the left side, and wisps of smoke were rising from beneath his pauldron.\n\nThere was a long scar left on the slope of the volcano. The layer of ash had been burned away, and the rock beneath had turned to lava, flowing down like a red river.\n\n'Hell…'\n\nSunny came to his senses when Slayer's elbow connected with his ribs, pushing him away. A moment later, she was already drawing her bow without sparing him a look. Kai was doing the same in the air, using only the strength of his core to pull the string.\n\nFar away, the crystalline swarm was speedily devouring the distance between the snowy peak and the volcano. The insect-like abominations had assembled into an odd formation in the sky, their translucent wings almost touching each other.\n\nThese wings were like lenses, focusing the light of the rising sun into a beam of pure white destruction. Each individual beast might not have been too dangerous, but when scores of them worked together… The defenders of the Ash Castle could very easily be turned to ash themselves.\n\nSunny blinked a couple of times, appalled. It seemed like the crystalline nightmare creatures were not as easy as they looked.\n\n'Fifteen moments, perhaps.'\n\nCursing under his breath, he called out:\n\n'Kai, are you alright?'\n\nThe archer responded from above, his voice sober:\n\n'Yes. I am not easily burned.'\n\nIt seemed that his words were both an answer and a command - as soon as he finished speaking, the fiery embers shining in his hair were extinguished, and the smoke rising from beneath his armor was blown away by the wind.\n\nSunny smiled darkly. 'Keep dodging, then!'\n\nAnother beam of incinerating light illuminated the slopes of the volcano, but this time, all three of them evaded out of the way in time. None of them were burned… however, Slayer and Kai had to slow down their barrage for a brief moment.\n\nSunny frowned. 'Are we actually going to die here?'\n\nEven if they had more time, Kai was running out of arrows. Slayer, meanwhile, was recalling hers - but each one took some time to return.\n\nAfter all, these arrows were not Memories. Unlike Saint, Slayer could not summon and dismiss Memories, so her armaments were merely enchanted in ingenious ways to resemble them. Her bow could turn into a slender chain and wrap itself around her arm like a vambrace, while her quiver was enchanted to summon arrows back through a special spatial storage.\n\nActually, quite a fascinating piece of sorcery went into marking the arrows and connecting them to the hidden dimensional layer of the quiver, as well as into making sure that they could be summoned back from a distance… But Sunny had no time to admire his own handiwоrk at the moment.\n\nHe hesitated for a split second, then glanced into the shadows. What Sunny wanted to do was reach his hand into them and retrieve the corpse of the first Great Beast that Slayer had killed, which was still laying on the slope of the distant mountain. However, as he moved faintly to do just that, he suddenly was overwhelmed by a cold, dreadful sensation. It was as if somеthing vast and frightening was looking back at him from the shadows, warning him to stay back.\n\n'What… is going on?'\n\nSunny was startled. This was the first time he had felt something like that… the dark expanse of shadow was supposed to be his home, so encountering something far deadlier than him there was an unwelcome novelty.\n\nIt almost felt as if a titanic tentacle would rise from the darkness to grasp him if he dared to step foot or even lay a finger on the snowy mountain.\n\n'Are we prohibited from attacking the enemy peak?'\n\nWhy would the being hiding beneath the clouds allow their arrows to land, but forbid them from moving across the sea of clouds personally?\n\nSunny shifted his reasoning, forcing himself to think about what was happening as a game.\n\nThe Snow Domain was attacking, so the Ash Domain was defending? That made a peculiar kind of essence.\n\nShooting at the attackers was considered an act of defense, but moving to the snowy peak seemed to be against the rules.\n\n'What happened to offense being the best defense, though?'\n\nSunny's gaze turned darker.\n\nWhile he was considering what to do next, Kai and Slayer had managed to slay a dozen more abominations. The crystalline beasts were quite near by now - enough so that Sunny could actually see shattered crystals and ancient bones resting inside their transparent bellies.\n\nIf there was one good piece of news, it was that the insect-like abominations had dove under the clouds of ash by now. The rising sun was obscured by the dark clouds, so there were no devastating beams of focused sunlight blasting the slope of the volcano anymore. Still, time was short.\n\nSunny inhaled deeply, preparing himself for the battle.\n\n'Hey, Kai! Remember how I said that our castle was absolutely horrible?'\n\nKai landed on the ground near him, sliding on the ash and nocking another arrow on the string.\n\n'Sure! Why?'\n\nSunny glanced at the approaching swarm of Great Beasts and smiled.\n\n'I changed my mind! Let's retreat into the castle, right now!'\n\nKai sent his arrow flying, looked at him briefly, then shot toward the Ash Castle without saying another word. Slayer followed, rushing into the caldera with breathtaking speed.\n\nFor a few seconds, Sunny was left alone on the pinnacle of the fuming volcano, looking at the swarm of Snow Beasts chillingly.\n\n'Weaver, you bastard…'\n\nHad Weaver known that someone would come to retrieve a part of their Legacy from Ariel's Game, one day? They had to - otherwise, it wouldn't have been hidden here in the first place.\n\nSo why the hell couldn't that damned daemon make retrieving their Legacy a little easier?\n\nCursing the Demon of Fate, Sunny called upon the shadows. In the next moment, hundreds of long spikes grew from the slope of the volcano, each ending in an awfully sharp tip.\n\nAnd then, all of them shot into the dark sky, rising to meet the descending swarm like a welcoming salvo.\n\nUsing the barrage of shadows as a cover, Sunny retreated toward the Ash Castle."

    "content": "2327 Proper Siege\n\nBy the time Sunny reached the main keep of the crumbling fortress, Kai and Slayer were already there. The vast interior of the castle was just as they hаd left it - vast, dark, and filled with nothing but smoke and ash.\n\n'What's the plan?'\n\nKai tried to sound calm, but there was a hint of tension in his voice.\n\nSunny hesitated for a moment.\n\n'Now… might be a good time to start praying.'\n\nThe gods were dead, though, so there was really no point. He flashed the charming archer a grin.\n\n'Hey, don't be too worried! This is not even one of the top ten worst situations I've been in.'\n\nKair forced out a pale smile.\n\n'O - oh… that's a relief, then. Just out of curiosity, though… what might one of the top ten worst situations you've been in look like?'\n\nSunny scratched the bаck of his head.\n\n'Well… this one time, I met a particularly loathsome bird. That one was pretty gruesome. Did I mention that I hate birds, by the way?'\n\nCrow Crow would have been quite offended to hear him saying that, but luckily, the peculiar Echo was not here right now.\n\nSunny turned to the gates of the keep.\n\n'In any way, the plan is simple.'\n\nAnswering his call, the shadows surged and rose. A moment later, all three entrances to the hollow interior of the Ash Castle - the gate and the circular openings in its floor and roof - were blocked by impenetrable walls of solidified shadows.\n\nDespite the questionable design of the ancient castle, it still offered a vital advantage to its defenders - there were only so many ways the enemy could get inside. Sunny doubted that the Great Beasts would be able to bring the walls of the keep down, which meant that he could syphon them into a narrow passage or two.\n\nThat was not exactly a trump card, but it was definitely better than fighting a hive of flying nightmare creatures in the open.\n\n'My shadows will slow those bees… those ants? They will slow those bugs down, but not stop them. Once the vermin start to break through, I will engage them in melee, while you two will support me from the back. If more than one entrance is breached, we will each concentrate on one.'\n\nNow that all entrances to the keep were barricaded, it was completely dark inside. Luckily, none of the defenders required light to see - Kai due to his Awakened Ability, Sunny and Slayer due to being shadows.\n\nKai counted the arrows in his quiver and frowned.\n\n'I must say, as far as plans go…'\n\nHe did not get to finish, however, because at that moment, something crashed into the roof of the keep.\n\nThen, something scraped against the ancient stone.\n\nAnd then, more and more scraping sounds surrounded them, echoing in the darkness.\n\nKai's face paled as he glanced up, his gaze penetrating the walls of the ancient fortress.\n\nSunny could sense what was happening outside, as well. His expression dimmed.\n\nThe muffled impacts and the dreadful scrаping fused into a strange litany, and then, the castle shook again as a deafening thunderclap made him wince.\n\nThe crystalline abominations had landed on the walls and the roof of the keep and were now ramming their bodies into the wall of shadows barring its main entrance.\n\nThe first crack appeared on the surface of the manifested shadow.\n\n'Hold!'\n\nAs Kai commanded the dark barricade to stay intact, the second impact failed to produce a new crack.\n\nThe third, however, did not.\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n'What to do, what to do…'\n\nIt used to be that he always lacked the means to deal with the endless tribulations facing him, searching for solutions desperately. Now that Sunny was a Supreme Titan, however, there were almost too many tools at his disposal.\n\nHis versatility was nothing short of singular, so it was not so much a question of finding a solution as a question of choosing the best solution out of many that were available to him.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Sunny split his mind into three streams.\n\n'Prepare yourselves.'\n\nOne stream focused on repairing the crumbling barricades, as well as manifesting shadows outside the castle - as the Great Beasts attacked it, sharp spikes protruded from its walls, impaling them. Black hands rose from the ash to break their limbs, and heavy chains wrapped themselves around their bodies, pulling them onto the spikes.\n\nSadly, the Great Beasts were both too powerful and too cunning to be severely harmed by the manifested shadows. A few of them had been killed or wounded in the initial barrage but now, they rapidly wisened up and started dodging the shadows - only to destroy them a moment later.\n\nThe crystalline insects were astonishingly nimble, both in the air and on the ground, so they fared well against the shadows. Still, they were forced to concentrate on destroying the barricades, which allowed Sunny to focus his countermeasures only on those spots and thus increase his efficiency.\n\nIt was a proper siege… one where the besieging army consisted of enormous glasslike insects, while the defending army consisted of one man controlling the shadows cast by the castle, but a proper one nevertheless.\n\nThe second mind stream was reserved for controlling Sunny's own body in the inevitable melee.\n\nWhile the third…\n\nThe third partition of his mind was responsible foг analyzing the situation and looking for the best solution to it. Sunny felt like he was missing something, and this feeling of making a mistake was driving him mad.\n\n'Above.'\n\nA violent impact shook the castle, and the seal of shadows blocking the opening in the roof of the keep suddenly fractured. A crystalline body exploded from the rain of black debris, but before it could lunge at the three defenders, two arrows hit its head - Kai pierced its left eye, while Slayer pierced its right eye.\n\nThe body of the enormous crystal insect plummeted down, while another got stuck in the quickly mending barricade - it would have freed itself a second later, but a split second later, a black arrow slid in the crack between its thorax and abdomen, severing the Great Beast in two.\n\nSlayer had killed it, and therefore, the [Handy Bracelеt] spoke into Sunny's ear:\n\n[You have slain an enemy.]\n\nHe scowled.\n\n'What am I missing?'\n\nJust then, the largest of the barricades - the one blocking the gate of the keep - was torn open by a wide fracture.\n\nCrystalline bodies filled the breach.\n\nGrasping his odachi, Sunny rushed forward.\n\n'Whatever it is, I hope I'll figure it out soon…'\n\nHe dove into the familiar cradle of battle."

    "title": "2328 Crown of Horns.docx",
    "content": "2328 Crown of Horns\n\nSunny rushed forward as the first of the crystalline insects burst through the breach. These great glasslike horrors glanced like grotesque bees, but also somewhat like dreadful ants… considering their warlike behavior, however, he decided to call them the Crystal Wasps.\n\nThe Crystal Wasps were Great Beasts, while he was a Supreme Titan. By all means, he was supposed to be much more powerful as far as pure physical prowess went… but it was not that easy. After all, his was a human body, while their physique was anything but.\n\nBoth a mouse and an elephant were beasts, but were they equal in strength? No. Similarly, humans were often physically inferior to Nightmare Creatures, even if their Rank was the same.\n\nSunny was still a Titan, though, so even his modest human body was stronger, faster, and more resilient than each of the grotesque abominations. And, naturally, nothing really prevented him from assuming a different form.\n\nAs Sunny dashed forward, his body turned into a surging wave of unfathomable darkness and then solidified into the fearsome form of a four-armed fiend. This time, he wasn't creating a Shell from the surrounding shadows - instead, he simply turned himself into a Shadowspawn. After all, Sunny was himself a shadow now. His human appearance was merely a form he assumed, so if he was familiar with a different one well enough, he could just as easily become something else.\n\nHis Shadowspawn form glanced pretty much exactly as the Devil he had been in the Second Nightmare - towering at three meters in height, encased in the fearsome black carapace of the Jade Mantle, and with four hands ready to tear and rend the flesh of his enemies. If there was one difference, though, it was that seven horns were crowning his head now instead of four. Suddenly, the Crystal Wasps did not dwarf him anymore. Neither were they as threatening anymore…\n\nBut they were still Great Beasts. Even if Sunny was stronger than them, he was still vulnerable to their malice. And… there were a lot of them, numerous more than he would have chosen to face, if there was a choice.\n\nNo being of the Great Rank could be taken lightly. He poured more shadows into his odachi, increasing its length to nearly three meters. Almost at the same time, the Crystal Wasps ignited with blinding radiance, chasing the darkness away - as if sunlight had been stored in their glasslike bodies. A wave of scorching heat washed over him, making him frown.\n\n'Curious…' That ability of theirs… was that how they built their hives? By melting tunnels in the ice? There was no time to ponder.\n\nThe first of the abominations was already upon Sunny - or rather, he was upon it. Slicing off its crystalline leg, which was poised to pierce his chest, Sunny rammed the creature with his shoulder and at the same time grabbed its frightening, razor-sharp mandibles with two of his four hands, pushing its head to the side and preventing it from biting a huge chunk of his flesh off. A split second later, he spun his odachi and slashed downward. The nimble Nightmare Creature easily dodged his strike even while reeling from being slammed into…\n\nHowever, it still convulsed and toppled, its lifeless body suddenly growing brittle and shattering into many shards with a melodious ringing. That was because Sunny had never aimed for the Crystal Wasp, to begin with - instead, his black odachi had severed its shadow from its glasslike body, thus destroying its soul. It wasn't easy to destroy the soul of a Great Beast in one strike, even when striking its shadow. However, Sunny's killing intent was especially deadly, because his will to kill was especially firm - the touch of his black blade carried uncompromising lethality, as if imbued with an echo of death itself.\n\nThe Crystal Wasp died instantly, unable to offer much resistance. That said… Sunny had not expected its body to crumble into innumerable shards. He had been planning to toss the corpse of the Great Beast at the other abominations rushing at him, thus slowing them down.\n\nInstead, anotheг insect-like Abomination was already lunging at him through the cloud of falling shards, a split second away from biting into his neck. Sunny reeled back to block the glass mandibles with his odachi, holding the hilt with two hands and bracing the flat of its blade with two more. The impact was tyrannical enough to push him back, but instead of falling and being buried under the mass of the Nightmare Creature, Sunny collapsed into the shadows and shot out of them behind the adversary almost at the same moment, his odachi falling down to split the adversary in two.\n\n[You have slain an adversary.]\n\nSpinning to face the next Crystal Wasp, Sunny saw that the barricade of shadows he was fervently repairing was continuing to crumble, and that four more abominations had made their way inside the keep in the time it took him to kill two.\n\nNevertheless, he was surprised by something.\n\n'Huh?' Why were the Crystal Wasps… weaker than he had expected?\n\nThey still possessed the dire power one would expect from Great Beasts, but it was significantly lower than it was supposed to be… than it had been, back when they were escaping the Ice Hive on the slopes of the snowy mountain.\n\nTwo abominations lunged at him at great speed, their radiant bodies creating a dizzying movement of light and shadows. The ash covering the floor rose like a whirlwind in the wake of their violent passage. 'The ash…' Sunny moved, raising his odachi to impale one of the abominations and at the same time catching the second one in the air.\n\nThis time, he did what Nephis had advised him to do, wrapping his will around his entire self instead of focusing primarily on his weapon. It was easy to feel the difference - despite being outnumbered, Sunny did not feel like the world was fighting against him just as hard. The willpower of the Ice Hive was pressuring him like a crushing wave, but strangely enough, Sunny was like a fish, cutting through it almost with ease.\n\nHe slammed one of the Crystal Wasps into the floor, causing the entire Ash Castle to tremble and for a web of cracks to appear on its transparent carapace.\n\nThe second Abomination was impaled on his great odachi, but that did not seem to slow it down much - its scythe-like legs scraped against the surface of the Jade Mantle, and the creature pushed itself lower across the length of the black sword, aiming to shred Sunny to pieces. The weight of its body was immense enough to make him stagger.\n\nHis armored foot descended upon the Crystal Wasp on the floor, shаttering its already cracked head, and at the same time, his tail wrapped itself around the second Nightmare Creature's thin neck.\n\n[You have slain an adversary.]\n\nFalling on all fours - on all six, to be precise - Sunny used his tail to send the Great Beast flying back. As if shot from a sling, the Nightmare Creature flew through the air and crashed into its advancing kin.\n\n'That's four.'\n\nIn the time it took Sunny to kill four Crystal Wasps…\n\nEight more had breached the barricade. The wall of shadows was collapsing faster than he could repair it, and the breach was growing wider with each second.\n\nSunny glanced at the mass of crystalline abominations somberly.\n\n'Damnation.'"

    "title": "2329 Defensive Advantage.docx",
    "content": "2329 Defensive Advantage\nSunny had faced seven Saints as a Transcendent, and now, he had to face a swarm of Great Beasts as a Supreme. The crystalline bodies of the eerily radiant abominations were shining blindingly with imprisoned sunlight, and shadows danced as they moved.\nFlakes of ash swirled in the air.\n'Ash…'\nMoving between shadows, Sunny suddenly had an epiphany. He had noted that the Crystal Wasps seemed weakened, and now, he suddenly understood why. The answer lay in the rules of Death Game.\n\nAs Seishan had mentioned, positioning and territorial conquest played an important role in this ancient game - that way, the power of Domains was expressed through rules. Figures had an advantage while defending squares of the same color… and were disadvantaged when attacking squares of the opposite color. The disadvantage diminished the more the besieged square was surrounded by the adversary Domain.\nAriel's Game was based on the same rules, so… The Ash Castle bordered two volcanoes and one snowy mountain… actually, was it three snowy mountains? Did diagonal borders count? In any case, it was not entirely surrounded by the Snow Domain, which meant that Sunny was supposed to have some kind of advantage.\nHe had not felt any boost to his power, though, which meant that his advantage lay elsewhere - to be precise, it was the abominations of the Snow Dоmain who were weakened by the surrounding ash.\n'That is good to know.'\nAnother piece of the puzzle was solved, and armed with that knowledge, he would be able to plan his subsequent moves better.\nFor now, however, Sunny had to survive the enemy move. His mastery of Shadow Step, which had long been woven into his battle art, allowed him a supreme degree of mobility on the battlefield.\n\nThat was why the Crystal Wasps could not immediately overwhelm him despite their superior numbers… Sadly, Sunny was not entirely free to move however he wanted, either - after all, he was supposed to serve as an impenetrable wall between the abominations and his allies. Therefore, he could not allow the Great Beasts to advance too far into the interior of the Ash Castle, meaning that he had to spend most of his time in front of the advancing swarm.\nThe issue was further exacerbated by the fact that in a battle between Great Nightmare Creatures and a Supreme being, the distinction between tangible and intangible was less meaningful than it would be for weaker cгeatures. In other words, the attacks of the Crystal Wasps were imbued by their rabid will and could thеrefore pursue him into the shadows.\n'Curse it!'\nThe shadows shifted again, pushed around by the radiant abominations, and Sunny was forced to step out of them a few meters away from where he wanted to be. Unwilling to let the оpportunity pass, Sunny transformed his odachi into a long spear and thrust it forward, piercing the joint of a Crystal Wasp's leg. He wrenched his spear, destroying the joint completely, and immediately leaped back.\nIn the next moment, another Nightmare Creature was already in the spot where he had been before, its terrifying mandibles closing on nothing but emptiness.\nSunny did not miss the chance to bring the butt of his spear upward, slamming it with ferocious force into the underside of the creature's head. Its skull cracked, and one of the mandibles shattered. Continuing to retreat, Sunny turned his torso and pushed his spear forward, piercing the eye of a different enemy, then spun it to drive two more a step back. With how overwhelmed he was by the enemy numbers, Sunny only managed to kill two more Crystal Wasps after the initial four.\nThe rest of them were battered and bore gruesome wounds, but were very much alive - and more were already entering through the breach, as well. Just then, however, a black arrow slid into the crack on the skull of the Nightmare Creature he had struck with the back of his spear. The Great Beast died instantly, Another arrow struck the Crystal Wasp who was moving slower than the rest due to the joint he had destroyed, making its massive body explode violently into a cloud of glass shards.\n[You have slain an enemy.]\nHaving already finished off a few abominations, Kai and Slayer were helping as best they could.\nBut there were just too many beasts.\nSunny could sense them scurrying across the exterior of the Ash Castle, forcing their way inside… His artillery support had managed to keep the Crystal Wasps off his back until now, but things were rapidly turning from bad to worse.\nThat was because, apart from the main barricade, the other two seals of shadows were crumbling too. The crystalline abominations were ramming their bodies into them with harrowing force, making the entire castle rattle and shake. Slayer was already splitting her attention between the main entrance and the lower seal - Kai would have to concentrate entirely on the upper seal, soon.\n\nIt was unclear how long the two of them would be able to hold the Crystal Wasps back.\nCatching his spear with his lower hands, Sunny moved it in a wide horizontal arch to behead a wounded Nightmare Creature, and at the same time caught another one with his upper hands. As the claws of his gauntlets sank into the crystalline carapace, he strained his muscles and viciously ripped the gigantic beast in two.\nThat cost him.\nNot a second later, something slammed into his back, and he felt a sharp pain permeating his body. Roaring, he spun, grabbed the attacking Crystal Wasp by the neck, and then slammed its head with his own.\nThe Nightmare Creature's head exploded into a rain of shards, and it fell into the ash, lifeless.\n[You have slain an enemy.]\n'This can't go on much longеr…'\nWhat was he missing?\nA part of his mind was still trying to puzzle out the peculiar feeling of failing to realize something.\nAs he did, an especially violent impact shook the castle, and the upper seal collapsed completely, Pale light poured into the dark interior of the keep, and then the darkness was torn apart by the radiant figures of the Crystal Wasps that burst inside, spreading to scurry across the ceiling.\n\nSlayer dodged a falling piece of rabble and gracefully dismissed her bow. Unsheathing her two swords, she lingered for a moment and tossed one of them to Kai. He caught it easily and flew back, hovering just behind her.\n'Sunny? What's the plan?'\nLosing his cover fire, Sunny was forced to retreat, as well.\nStepping out of the shadows back to back with them, he allowed himself to return to his human form and glanced at the swarm of Great Beasts surrounding them from all sides.\n'Ah, I see now.'\nHis lips twisted into a vicious smile.\n'No worries. Leave it to me, buddy… my plan is to slaughter them all!'"

    "title": "2330 Volcanic Glass.docx",
    "content": "2330 Volcanic Glass\n\nSunny was no stranger to strategic rеtreats. There was no shame in running away with his tail tucked between his legs - when facing an adversary that he could not defeat, that was the best choice.\nAnd just a few seconds ago, Sunny had been sure that they would not be able to defeat the Ice Hive. \n\nThe problem, though, was that there was nowhere for them to retreat. They were trapρed on the volcano, and trying to escape it would provoke the ire of the being that dwelled beneath the clouds… Sunny had considered destroying the chains holding the Ash Castle above the main vent and plummeting into the fiery depths with the Crystal Wasps, but that did not seem like a good idea either.\n\nAnd then, it hit him.\n[You have slain an adversary.]\n\n'Ah…'\nSunny suddenly realized that there was a disadvantage to possessing overwhelming strength.\nBeing strong tended to make one stupid.\n\nHe had grown powerful enough as a Sovereign to develop bad habits… no, truthfully, it might have started to happen all the way back when he was a Saint.\nWhen Sunny had been weak, he obsessively considered every single possibility to find a way to survive. But after becoming strong, he fell into the habit of relying more on his strength than on his mind, wrecking his enemies like a Supreme sledgehammer. That was why he had been slow to understand how to defeat the Ice Hive.\n\n'I have slain these enemies.'\nSunny had killed about ten Crystal Wasps, and Slayer had killed a dozen more - first as they flew across the sea of clouds, and then here in the main keep of the Ash Castle.\n\nThe Handy Bracelet had announced the kills, even if it couldn't determine the Rank and Class of the slain enemies. It couldn't determine thеm because Sunny's cores were already saturated, and he received no shadow fragments for the kills. However, that did not mean that he received nothing.\n\nThe shades of the slain Crystal Wasps would still enter his Soul Sea, even if Sunny had no access to his Soul Sea and was cut off from his Domain. They would…\nHe was pretty sure that even Ariel would not have been able to change that.\n\nAnd why would he?\n'Why would Ariel rob the Ash Tyrant of all power?'\nSunny and Kai could not summon new Memories, but the Memories they had summoned before entering Ariel's Game were still working as intended. He was pretty sure that if he created new ones, they would be able to use them as well. Apart from that, some facets of their Aspects were suppressed, but their Aspect Abilities still worked just fine.\n\nSunny could use his Dormant, Awakened, Ascended, and Transcendent Abilities…\nSo why wouldn't he be able to use his Supreme Ability?\nHis Domain was not gone, after all. It was merely replaced with the Domain of Ash. Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that his Suρreme Ability was also substituted instead of being entirely blocked?\nWhat was the point of granting him a Domain if he could not make use of it?\n\n'I see now. This… should work, right?'\nHaving thought that, Sunny immediately erased the thought from his mind.\n\nA new thought took its place:\n'I see now. This will definitely work.'\nThere was no place for doubt if one wanted to force his will upon the world. And Sunny was going to do just that. Even if he could not enter his Soul Sea and summon the shades he had earned before entering Ariel's Game…\nWho was to say that he could not summon the shades he had earned after entering it?\nEven if someone said it, Sunny was not obliged to believe them.\n\nSo, just as the Crystal Wasps surrounded them - some of them rushing across the ash covering the floor of the castle, some moving across its ceiling - Sunny inhaled deeply and turned into a shadow.\nThen, he activated his Supreme Ability, opening a gate between his soul and the world…\nAnd called upon the shades.\n\nFor a moment, nothing happened.\n\n'S - sunny?'\nKai's voice sounded nervous. Slayer, meanwhile, crouched into a low stance, preparing to take as many Great Beasts as she could with her into the embrace of death. \n\nThen, a gust of cold wind blew across the interior of the Ash Castle, and the ash stirred.\nThe ash stirred and rose, forming dark shapes.\n\nJust as the Crystal Wasps rushed to devour Sunny and his companions, Obsidian Wasps - shades formed by ash, their bodies resembling volcanic glass - rose to face them.\nThere were twenty of them, so the enemy still outnumbered the defenders of the castle manyfold… \n\nBut it did not matter.\nBecause with each Great Abomination they killed, a Supreme shade would join the ranks of the defenders.\n\nAssuming his corporeal form once again, Sunny grinned and threw a poignant look at Kai. \nThe charming archer seemed to have lost the ability to speak for a second.\n'As I said, don't worry. You sеe, Kai… death always wins.'\n\nBecause death was inevitable.\nWith that, Sunny tossed his spear into the mass of Crystal Wasps, killing one of them, and rushed forward while manifesting a new weapon out of the shadows.\n\nA violent battle took place in the Ash Castle, making it quake and rattle. A few of the shades were destroyed, and then, a few more. But new ones immediately took their place, lunging at the crystalline insects without fear or doubt. Even if each individual Obsidian Wasp was weaker than their former kin due to not possessing the Will, the Titan who had summoned them did.\nSunny could also fight much more freely now that he was supported by a small army of shades. As a result, his lethality increased explosively.\nKai and Slayer did not waste any time, either.\n\nSoon enough, the outcome of the battle hung in precarious balance. The Ice Swarm had been reduced almost by half, and the number of the ash shades swelled. Victory was not decided yet, but Sunny felt that the odds were in their favor.\n\nIt was then that a subtle ripple seemed to spread through the world.\nAlmost at the same moment, the remaining Crystal Wasps did something peculiar.\n\nThey all turned back and rushed away, escaping the Ash Castle.\nSunny was startled.\n'Are they… fleeing?'\n\nSince when had Nightmare Creatures - mere Beasts, no less - had enough presence of mind to suppress their frenzy and flee from an unfavorable battle?\nFrowning, he followed the Crystal Wasps outside.\nCresting the edge of the caldera, Sunny witnessed a breathtaking sight.\nThe Crystal Wasps were flying back to the distant mountain.\nThe sun had risen above the horizon, and the golden light of dawn turned into bright daylight.\n\nAnd almost as soon as dawn burned itself out…\nThe resplendent radiance of the ethereal glass bridges dimmed.\nThe gossamer bridges crumbled, turning into plumes of snow, and were dispersed by the wind.\nBefore too long, nothing connected the lonesome mountains once again.\n\nThe dawn was over, and with it, the enemy move came to an end."

    "title": "2331 Last Square.docx",
    "content": "2331 Last Square\nThe sun had risen above the realm of clouds and mountains… above the world of Ariel's Game. The ethereal, glistening bridges turned to snow under its radiance.\nSunny was standing on the edge of the caldera, his battered armor slowly repairing itself, as he glanced north - there, far away, the surviving Crystal Wasps had landed on the slopes of the snowy peak and disappeared into the myriad entrances to the Ice Hive.\n'The adversary move is over.'\nTaking a deep breath, he glanced west. There, the giant body of the Snow Worm was coiled around the volcano, its pale flesh standing out starkly against the black ash.\n\nThen, he glanced east… somewhere out there, the clockwork giant was standing in the ash, as well.\nThe Ash Castle had withstood the siege, but the other two volcanoes were now conquered by the Snow Domain. As Sunny watched, a startling change took place.\nTwo pillars of lava shot out of the conquered volcanoes, rapidly solidifying in the cold air. At the same time, the snowstorm veiling the distant mountains moved south, consuming the world. It flowed past the Ash Castle, sparing it the elemental fury, and completely obscured the neighboring volcanoes.\nJust then, Kai landed on the ash beside him.\n'What is going on? Why did they retreat?'\n\nSunny hesitated for a while, struggling against the powerful winds as he glanced into the swirling mass of snow that swallowed the world, sparing only the billowing clouds of ash above the Ash Castle.\n'They retreated because their time ran out. It seems that Snow figures can only move at dawn.'\nHe paused for a moment, then added slоwly:\n'I guess the Ash figures can only move at dusk, then.'\n\nSunny imagined ash blowing across the sea of crimson clouds, turning into obsidian bridges in the fiery glow of the dying sun. Yes… that would make sense.\nHe glanced at Kai.\n'As for what is going on… I think we will see soon. Two more squares were conquered by the Snow Domain.'\n\nJust as he finished speaking, the violent winds suddenly settled down, and the great snowstorm passed. Dark clouds still boiled above the Ash Castle, but the rest of the world was resting under a clear blue sky now.\nThe other two volcanoes… had disappeared.\nOr rather, transformed. The deep calderas were buried under solidified lava, turning into sharp peaks. The thick layers of ash had been blown away by the wind. The dark slopes were stripped bare, and then covered in snow.\nTwo snowy peaks stood where the fuming volcanoes had been just minutes ago, and the Ash Castle was now completely surrounded by the Snow Domain. It was the last black square left on the board.\n'Well… that sucks.'\nSunny sighed, then patted Kai on the shoulder.\n'I'm going to be quite busy, but you can rest until evening. We'll do something exciting then.'\nKai blinked a couple of times.\n'Sure, I'll… wait. What are we going to do in the evening?'\nSunny simply shrugged.\n'I have no idea, yet. But… it is bound to be exciting! Doesn't it?'\nWith that, he turned back and headed back to the Ash Castle.\n\n***\nSome time later, Sunny was sitting on the floor, feeling a little miserable.\n'These damn daemons.'\nAriel had done something incredible, hiding forty - nine mountains inside a game board and populating them with powerful abominations. The Demon of Dread was truly great and awful.\nBut, that godly bastard…\nDid he not think to provide the poor Nightmare Creatures imprisoned in his game with basic necessities?\nThere was no food to be found anywhere, unless Sunny wanted to dine on an infinite amount of worm meat. Much worse, there was no water. The figures of the Snow Domain could at least melt the snow to quench their thirst, but what was he supposed to do? Was he supposed to melt ash? How would that work?\n\nSunny shook his head dejectedly.\nOf course, he did not really need to eat or drink. As a Supreme demigod, he could simply sustain himself by absorbing essence, and more than that, he was a shadow, not a real human. But not needing food and not wanting to eat were two different matters - otherwise, he would not have been pampering Nephis with delicious meals at every opportunity. There was Kai to consider, as well. As a Saint, he could last quite a while without water, but not to the degree of not needing it at all.\nPerhaps Ariel had not designed this game for humans.\n'One more problem to solve…'\n\nAs Sunny was relaxing on the soft ash, there was a lot of activity around him.\nAfter all, just because he was sitting and doing nothing didn't mean that he was doing nothing. All around him, the shades of the Crystal Wasps were busy at work. There were a couple of dozen of them left intact, while the rest were being rebuilt and repaired within the dark depths of his soul. Some were collecting soul shards of their fallen kin… or perhaps even retrieving them fгom their own corpses… while some were gathering and sorting crystal fragments themselves.\n\nSunny observed his worker wasps with a curious expression, wondering if they would be able to focus sunlight into destructive beams with their obsidian wings. If they could, then he would be able to melt the snow on the mountains from a distance, then collect the water in some kind of giant reservoir…\nAs he considered this matter, Kai descended from above and landed on the ash near him. Glancing at Slayer, who was standing motionlessly behind Sunny, he bowed politely and offered her the short sword she had lent him previously.\n'Thank you, Lady… uh… Lady Slayer.'\nSlayer glanced at him before accepting the sword and sheathing it silently.\nKai shivered under her gaze, then sat down near Sunny and exhaled slowly.\nSunny looked at him:\n'How are your wounds?'\nKai had been caught in that first solar attack, but it was hard to say how bad his burns were underneath the armor.\nThe charming archer shook his head with a smile.\n'It's nothing serious. As I mentioned, I am not easily burned.'\nSunny clicked his tongue.\n'That might be true, but we are stuck here without a healer, and there are numerous battles ahead. Such small wounds will accumulate if we're not careful.'\nHis own back was shredded pretty badly. Luckily, he healed at breathtaking speed as a Supreme - this wound would be gone in no more than a day.\nOf course, a new one would very likely take its place.\nKai hesitated for a few seconds, then said suddenly:\n'We… we really defeated a hundred Great Beasts, didn't we?'\nHe shook his head in disbelief.\nSunny lingered with the answer.\n\nEventually, he said:\n'I guess we did. That… was a humbling experience, wasn't it?'\nKai chuckled.\n'Humbling? I wouldn't say that. I think it was more of an unbelievable experience.'\nHe glanced at Sunny, swept his hair back, and then said ruefully:\n'I know that I'll regret asking… but that was probably a routine battle for you, wasn't it?'\nSunny studied Kai for a few seconds, then shook his head with a faint smile.\n'No… actually, that was a novel level of peril even for me.'"

    "content": "2332 Payday\nSunny chuckled.\n'Actually, I haven't felt this weak in a long while. It was a good reminder, though - I was beginning to grow arrogant.'\nKai stared at him incredulously for a bit.\n',Beginning? Did you say 'beginning' to grow arrogant?'\nSunny gave him a reproachful look and laughed.\n'Ah, right. Your first impression of me was meeting the Lord of Shadows. Don't let it deceive you, though - that haughty guy is merely one of the roles I played. The real me is not nearly as conceited.'\nHe scoffed.\n'I mean, whу does someone as incredibly wealthy, unimaginably powerful, and unbearably handsome as I even have to be conceited?\nKai blinked a couple of times.\n'In, deed. I think I understand. I had to play the role of myself for a long time, too, back when I was a singer. I guess you had your reasons.'\nHe paused for a moment, then asked curiously:\n'But what is the real you like, then?'\nSunny shrugged.\n'The real me? Oh… I am a modest man with modest goals. All I really want is to run a quaint cafe, make a little money on the side by selling Memories, become a god, and go on romantic dates with my girlfriend from time to time.'\n\nKai stared at him silently for a moment.\n'Excuse me? What was that in the middle?'\nSunny smiled brightly.\n'What, becoming a god? Isn't that a given? One can't even run a cafe in peace these days without becoming a god first… it is honestly annoying. Plus, my angelic girlfriend is a tad ambitious, so I have to keep up!'\nKai coughed a few times.\nSunny, meanwhile, glanced at the pile of soul shards the Obsidian Wasps had dutifully put in front of him. The shards shone gorgeously, dispelling the deep darkness of the Ash Castle…\nHis eyes glinted.\n'Look at that, Kai. Dozens of Supreme soul shards! Can you even imagine how much this pile costs? That is… at least a crapton of credits right there!'\nKai glanced at the radiant shards, remained silent for a moment, then smiled with a hint of wistfulness in his mesmerizing green eyes.\n'Oh. Indeed, You reminded me of someone just now, when you said that.'\nSunny glanced at him briefly.\n'You mean Aiko? Right, she used to work for you at one point, didn't she?'\nKai nodded.\n'Yeah. She was my manager after I Awakened. But we haven't seen each other in a while. How… is she doing?'\nSunny let out a laugh.\n'Aiko? Oh, she is having a blast. It is a bit funny - she used to run a gambling den in the Bright Castle, but now she pretty much runs the entire Dark City. She also manages Shadow Clan's network all over both worlds… running a secret organizаtion of that scale is a complicated affair, so she spends a lot of time in Bastion.'\nKai let out a quiet sigh.\n'That's good. I'm happy that she's happy. Although, to be honest… I am a little surprised. We went our separate ways because I wanted to follow the Path of Ascension and use my power for a noble cause, while she wanted nothing to do with causes after the Forgotten Shore. I thought she wanted to be a civilian. So, I didn't expect her to end up as a Sovereign's personal assistant.'\nSunny scratched the back of his head.\n'Well, it just ended up like that. I didn't set out to exploit her that way - initially, I simply hired her to help me run a Memory shop. But one thing led to another, and before I knew it, she was in charge of my entire operation.'\nHe blinked a couple of times.\n'Come to think of it… wait, have I been conned? Did she hoodwink me into bankrolling her shady underground empire with my fortune?'\nKai laughed.\n'No, no. I am sure you are exploiting a mere Awakened like her, Supreme Sunless, and not the other way around. Definitely.'\n\nSunny grinned.\n'Yeah… yeah, naturally! Obviously.'\nFinishing enjoying the view of the soul shards, he turned to several piles of crystal fragments instead. The Obsidian Wasps had chosen only the suitable ones, separating them into several large piles by form and size.\nHe picked one up and traced his finger along its edge, His jade skin was instantly cut… which was impressive enough.\nNo blood seeped out of the cut, and a few seconds later, it had alreаdy healed itself.\n'Wonderful.'\nThe soul shards would become the anchors for weaves of the Memories he wanted to create, but the remains of the Crystal Wasps could serve as an excellent medium for the enchantments.\nAfter all, Memories had to be crafted from something, and materials harvested from Grеat Nightmare Creatures were superior to permanently manifested shadows. These crystalline shards were especially sharp and durable, making them perfect for crafting arrowheads.\nActually… there was someone here who was quite amazing at crafting arrows from similar materials. Slayer had spent thousands of years making her own weapons from what she could find in the Shadow Real, and the most readily available resource there was obsidian.\nSunny glanced at her and raised an eyebrow.\n'Hey. How about helping me with this?'\nShe stared at him chillingly, which made him clear his throat.\n'Oh. Right…'\nIt was time for another payment.\nSunny used the same shard of crystal to slice open his forearm - this time, the cut quickly swelled with blood.\nSlayer finally moved, lowering herself to one knee beside him under Kai's startled gaze.\nShe put her hands together and placed them under his arm, allowing his blood to flow into them. When the chalice of her hands was nearly full, Sunny stemmed the bleeding and watched as she raised them to her veiled lips.\nA few moments later, the blood was gone. Slayer did not really drink it - instead, it was simply absorbed into her ebony skin, disappearing forever behind the veil.\nHer dark eyes were distant, full of some vague, indescribable emotions for a heartbeat.\nThen, the hint of emotion was replaced by the familiar, cold malice.\nKai stammered.\n'W - what was that?'\nWatching his cut heal, Sunny chuckled and glanced at him with a smile.\n'That?'\nHe shrugged.\n'That was payday.'"

    "title": "2333 Pit Stop.docx",
    "content": "2333 Pit Stop\nSlayer seemed satisfied with her payment. Of course, it was a little tactless of her to demаnd his blood when they were imprisoned in a lethal daemonic realm - but actually, she was being unexpectedly considerate.\n\nAfter all, it did not escape Sunny's attention that the murderous Shadow had foregone their usual duel. He had fully expected that Slayer would attack him as soon as there was a chance, but she seemed to have decided against it.\nThis was the first time Slayer spared him the hassle of beating her into submission.\n'I guess we're making progress.'\n\nTossing the crystal shard back onto the pile, Sunny pointed to Kai's bow.\n'Give that here.' Receiving it, he studied the weapon thoughtfully. Unlike the arrows, he was not planning to turn the bow into a Memory - doing that would have required imbuing it with permanence, which would weaken it. But that did not mean that he could not enchant it.\n\nSunny had created plenty of enchanted items that were not Memories, after all, like various implements for thе radiant Empоrium and the Beast Farm. The fundamental weaves shared by all Memories, and which therefore defined what a Memory was, were so ingeniously designed and useful that there was usually no reason not to bestow them on a weapon or a piece of equipment. But that did not mean that they were necessary. It was just that the spellweave had to be woven a bit differently for an enchanted item that was not a Memory.\n\nFor example, Awakened usually needed to activate the enchantments of their Memories with essence, and only the essence of the person to whom the Memory belonged could do the job. The Memory itself was a concept moored to the master's soul, while manifesting it turned their soul essence into matter - so there was an innate connection between Awakened and their Memories. An enchanted item was different, since it was inherently ownerless. So, Sunny had to either weave the identity of the master into the enchantments or change their activation principle entirely, allowing them to accept anyone's soul essence.\nThe latter offered a sea of possibilities.\n\nSunny was especially concerned about Kai's reserve of essence - the charming archer was merely a Transcendent Beast, after all, so his essence capacity was one seventh of what Sunny himself possessed as a Saint. The enemies they faced, meanwhile, were immensely powerful…\nKai would need as much firepower as he could get to fight them effectively, but truly potent enchantments would burn through his soul essence in moments. There would be no time for him to fully replenish it either, considering that they might need to enter battle twice a day.\n\nSunny had to strike a careful balance between potency and sustainability - if the bow could accept anyone's essence, however, he could assist Kai by using his own.\nHe could even make the bow an essence vessel and saturate it with powerful Supreme essence in advance.\n'Hmm…'\nSunny sighed.\n\nNow that he had become the ruler of the Ash Domain - which was reduced to a single volcano - he felt like a pauper again. His tens of thousands of shades were gone, and the seemingly boundless river of spirit essence that constantly flowed into his soul had run dry. Compared to what he usually enjoyed, there was merely a trickle. So, he couldn't go all out and supply Kai with an ocean of his essence. Additionally, Sunny did not know how to make his essence follow the charming archer's commands. It was an interesting challenge, though… he was not sure that he could solve it, but he felt like he could cheat it somehow, at least to some degree.\n'Yeah… that solution might work. This one, too. I just have to be modest in my ambition.'\nHe could not replace Kai's essence with his own, but he could at least supplement it.\n\nAs for enchantments themselves, Sunny was no stranger to crafting bows and arrows. He had gone through the process of designing the optimal combination both for Rain and fоr Slayer, so all he had to do was adjust a few things with Kai's Aspect in mind.\nFor example…\nUnlike most archers, Kai could see through solid objects. So, wouldn't it be prudent to design him an arrow that could phase through matter?\n'Wait. Such an arrow would be amazing in the hands of any skilled archer!'\nWhy had he not made one before?\n\nWell… it was probably because making things pass through matter was not that easy. He could potentially play with tangible and intangible states, possibly even use an altered version of the [Unseen] enchantment of the Moonlight Shard, but there were a few obstacles to overcome.\nMaking an arrow pass through solid matter was easy in theory, but in practice, there was no such thing as easy matter in the Dream Realm. All materials had their own mystical properties - especially so the bodies of living beings. So, as much as Sunny wanted to make an arrow that would phase through the armor of an Nightmare Creature and strike directly at the tender flesh beneath, he couldn't, for now.\nMaking an arrow that could phase through a mass of rock and strike an adversary hiding behind it, though?\nThat was a possibility.\n'Oh, my… I'm inspired…'\nSummoning four shadow hands, Sunny lamented the absence of Weaver's Needle and got to work.\n\nHe would work on the bow first, then the quiver, and finally craft a few arrows.\nKai needed some kind of melee weapon, as well. The weapon could be crafted from the larger pieces of shattered crystal left behind by the slain Wasps… there were Supreme materials and Supreme soul shards at Sunny's disposal, so he would be able to create something truly destructive.\nThe only limit was time. He had until sunset to prepare Kai for battle, so he had to be modest in his ambition.\n'That's alright… I can take it one step at a time.'\nHe could weave a basic enchantment for the bow and create a couple of arrows today. Then, he could continue to improve the bow and add new arrows to Kai's arsenal after each battle. There would be more dead abominations and more materials for him to work with, as well… his Beasts would continue to grow stronger with each day.\nHis army of shades would continue to grow in number, as well.\nWhich was a good thing…\nBecause, at the end of it all, they would have to face the Snow Tyrant.\n'We are going to need all the power in the world to kill that thing, for sure…'\nSunny became engrossed in weaving."

    "title": "2344 Bitter Solitude.docx",
    "content": "2344 Bitter Solitude\nAs Sunny worked, Kai remained silent for a while, resting. It did not seem like he was ready to sleep, and there was nothing really for him to do on the barren volcano. The charming archer glanced at the walls of the crumbling fortress for a while - or rather, through them. He was observing their enemies, most likely.\n\nThe remaining Crystal Wasps, the snow worm, the clockwork giant… 'Stop staring at the frightening Nightmare Creatures, Kai. That will only wind up more, not help you recover.'\nKai slowly glanced away from whatever horror he was observing and focused on Sunny. Eventually, he asked:\n'That is a strange form of sorcery. I don't think I've ever seen anyone enchant something in that way before.'\nSunny nodded.\n'I don't think there's anyone else capable of performing this form of sorcery in the world, anymore. I'm the only one.'\nKai had to have an idea of what his Aspect Abilities were. So, he would know that creating Memories was a skill Sunny possessed, not an Ability. The charming archer glanced at him with interest.\n\n'How did you learn it?'\nSunny responded without looking up, his six hands forming the spellweave inside the black bow, one string of shadow essence at a time. 'Oh. One of my Attributes allows me to see the spellweave of Memories, while another one allows me to touch it. One time… I was in a pretty desperate situation. So I figured out how to create a rudimentary Memory to escape it.'\nHe smiled faintly.\n'Then, it was just a lot of research, study, and experimentation. I slowly taught myself how to do more by watching what the Spell does.'\nHe glanced at Kai briefly.\n'What about you? You seem to be perfectly suited for Shaping, with that Aspect of yours. Have you not tried to master it?'\nKai chuckled.\n'Oh… I tried. I seem to be a special case, though. Some people have a talent for Shaping, while some people don't. What I have, however, is negative talent.'\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n'How so?'\nKai shrugged with a smile.'Because of my Aspect, the True Names I invoke are extremely powerful. In exchange, however, it is especially difficult for me to master them… Lady Nephis thinks that it's the way for the world to balance things out.'\nHe sighed.\n'I can't even speak the Names as a human - at least nоt yet. I can invoke them pretty easily as a dragon, though, almost as if a dragon's maw is meant to bellow them. But it's of no use, really, since I can barely keep the Names in my mind. Even after years of effort, I've only mastered a meager few.'\n\nSunny contemplated his words for a few seconds. 'I'm not buying that someone like you is not meant to be a Shaper. Maybe you just have not met the condition to master the Sorcery of Names, yet. Things will probably change dramatically when you reach a higher Rank. Alternatively… it might be connected to your Aspect Legacy. Or not. You have not received it yet, have you?'\nKai shook his head.\n'No. But I don't see how an Aspect Legacy can help me become a better sorcerer. Aren't Legacy Relics usually just powerful Memories?'\nSunny chuckled.\n'Usually, уes. But not always. Oh, and technically, Legacy Relics do not need to be powerful - they just need to complement your Aspect greatly.'\nHe pointed to himself with one of his forty - two fingers.\n'Take me, for example. My Aspect Legacy is actually a… skillset, of sorts. I developed it myself, but the Spell had helped me take the first step - or rather, take it faster. It also used to reward me with Relics when I reached certain milestones. Then there is Nephis, whose Aspect Legacy is based in understanding, and who is rewarded for it with nothing except knowledge.'\n\nHe returned to weaving the strings of shadow essence.\n'So even though most Aspect Legacies are indeed Memories, or more rarely Echoes, not all of them are.'\nThey remained silent for a while. At some point, however, Kai studied him with a neutral expression and asked tentatively:\n'Sunny… can I ask you something?'\nSunny nodded while keeping his focus on the black blow.\nKai hesitated for a few seconds.\n'Before… you told me that my survival would depend on my companions, while their survival would depend on me. That no one survives in the Dream Realm alone.'\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n'So I did.'\nKai lingered for a while.\n'But you were living in Godgrave all alone when we met. A solitary Saint, all alone in the world. Did… did you speak from experience, or was it simply common wisdom?'\nSunny smiled faintly.\nA Saint… a Saint was someone who had braved the Dream Realm and conquered three Nightmares. As far as Sunny knew, there was only one person who had conquered the Third Nightmare alone - the Princess of War, Morgan of Valor.\nKai seemed to be curious about his previous solitude. He sighed.\n'I spoke from experience. I had someone to depend on, too, in the past. I had companions.'\n'You were one of them, dummy.'\nKai glanced at him mournfully, not saying anything… and yet, it seemed like he wanted Sunny to say more. Sunny chuckled.\n'Well, it did not end well.'\nHe picked up one more soul shard and placed it into the weave, carefully anchoring innumerable strings of essence to it.\n'It did not end well because I betrayed my companions, and lost them. I want to say that I had a good reason to abandon them… maybe I did… but in the end, it was a selfish reason. I am a very selfish person, Kai. I am a very greedy person as well. My selfish greed was my undoing.'\n\nWhat would have happened if Sunny had stayed with his cohort and faced the First Seeker with them? If he had made a different wish? Would it have been for the best? Or would he have spent the rest of his days living in regret? Had he made an unforgivable mistake? He did not know.\nHe did know that he regretted losing his companions bitterly, though. Some days, it felt too bitter to endure.\nKai shook his head slowly.\n'You do not look like someone who is undone, Sunny.'\nThere was some truth to that, Sunny was a Sovereign, after all.\n\nHe glanced at Kai and smiled.\n'Looks can be deceiving.'"

    "title": "2335 Changing Shadow.docx",
    "content": "2335 Changing Shadow\nAfter that, the conversation fizzled out. Sunny focused on weaving, while Kai tactfully gave him some space.\n\n'This is a bit tricky.' Sunny had done quite a bit of weaving in his life, but he could not remember ever having to enchant something on such a strict deadline. One day was really not enough to create something worthy, but he put great effort into arming Kai as best he could.\n\nHe also decided to design a set of enchantments for the bow that could be implemented in stages. That was a new approach for him and required a different way of creating a weave. But if Sunny succeeded here, he could potentially save himself a lot of trouble in the future.\nAfter all, up until now, he always had to complete the entire weave in one go - otherwise, the unfinished pattern of shadow strings would quickly collapse as soon as Sunny released his hold on it. If he could come up with a way to рrevent that from happening, he would have far fewer headaches while tackling truly complicated enchantments.\nNecessity was truly the mother of invention.\nStill, Sunny felt hurried and tense while working on the bow.\n'I miss my shadows…' Having one paltry body to work with felt stifling. It was really quite frustrating… how did people even manage to live their entire lives in such an inconvenient way?\n'Poor mortals… they must be struggling every day…' Unthinkable!\nSunny scoffed, remembering his own struggles vaguely. He had grown accustomed to controlling several bodies at the same time a while ago, so the very idea of only possessing one seemed strange now. Not to mention the idea of only perceiving the world through one vessel…\nSunny had been experiencing the world through many points of view for the past year. Suddenly finding himself all alone in his own head felt both comforting and disconcerting.\n…It was through this feeling of strangeness that he realized how far from being a human he had strayed without ever fully realizing it. Sunny knew that he was a shadow now, not a human being - but that was merely a difference of form.\nHere in Ariel's Game, however, he had no choice but to admit that his very mind was growing further and further apart from that of a human. It had nothing to do with becoming numb to human emotions, like what Nephis had experienced due to the agony of her Flaw, and more with… the nature of his consciousness itself.\n\nBut then again, maybe it was not that different after all, on the fundamental level.\nWas it merely a matter of repetition? Sunny remembered how vivid and horrifying his first encounter with an Abomination had been. But after facing and slaying a myriad of them, he barely felt anything when encountering yet another ghastly horror. He had grown calloused to their presence.\nThe same held true for human experiences. People naturally changed as they grew older and accumulated calluses on their hearts… the emotions of a wisened old man were deeply different from the feelings of a child, for whom every occasion was new and exciting.\nAt the same time, there was a natural limit to a human's lifespan, as well as to the number of events they could experience at any given time.\nBut what if that limit was removed?\nWhat if a human could live for a thousand years while experiencing a thousand different perspectives? How different would the mind of such a being become, and would it still be even remotely human?\nSunny sighed.\n'I'm changing.' He was still young, and he had already changed so much. What kind of person would he become in a decade?\nThe fact that his consciousness was slowly transforming to resemble that of a deity was both a promising sign and an eerie omen. It was good to know that he was well on his way to Apotheosis, but still…\nSunny had already seen Supreme humans who had lost most, if not all, of their humanity. The example of Anvil and Ki Song was right in front of his eyes, and they were both hateful. He hoped that he would never become callous and indifferent to human suffering like they had. That he would not change that much.\n'Ah. I miss my True Name, as well.' A True Name was meant to serve as an anchor of one's self. Without it, the promise of unending change seemed frightening.\nThat said… even in the throes of unease, Sunny knew that some things about him would never change.\nFor example, his love for Nephis.\nThe two of them had been separated numerous times - by the conflicting nature of their values and beliefs, by the boundaries separating different worlds, by the fatal depths of political strife, and even by fate itself.\nAnd yet, despite it all, they still always ended up together. Nothing had been able to pull them apart yet, and he knew that nothing would ever be able to pull them apart in the future, either.\nThat was one constant in his tumultuous life.\n'Funny.'\nSunny thought of himself as an anchor that kept Nephis tethered to humanity.\nMaybe she was his anchor, as well.\nTaking a deep sigh, he forced his six hands to move even faster.\nIn the end, he succeeded in placing the first enchantment on Kai's bow, as well as crafting two powerful arrows from the crystal shards. He even managed to enchant the charming archer's quiver.\nIt was a good start…\nAnd there was still some time left before sunset.\nTurning his head, Sunny glanced at the altar standing at the heart of the Ash Castle.\nAnd at the jade figure of a Snow Beast laying on it.\nHis eyes narrowed.\n'Shall I?'\nLetting Kai experiment with his improved bow and new arrows, Sunny rose from the ash and walked over to the altar. Slayer followed behind, her steps soft and quiet.\nPicking up the figure of the Snow Beast, Sunny hesitated for a while.\n'I wonder what truth I will learn this time.'\nHow about learning why the world had ended?\nTaking a deep breath, he focused on what he wanted to learn and tossed the jade beast into the billowing smoke."

    "title": "2336 A Strange Truth.docx",
    "content": "2336 A Strange Truth\n\nThe sun was rising above the wine - dark sea. Its gentle rays caressed an island where white stones were drowning in the verdant grass, and colorful flowers blossomed in the pleasant heat.\nA forest covered the slopes of the island like a carpet, and at its highest point, a woman was resting in the shade of an olive tree.\n\nShe wore a knee - length chiton, its pristine fabric as white as snow, with a deer's skin tied around her shoulders. Her hair was cut short, held back by a simple leather band. Her gaze was calm and sober.\n\nAs the woman rested, a doe emerged from the forest. Instead of being scared of the human, it approached her tentatively and lowered itself to the ground, resting its head on her lap. The woman lowered her hand to caress the wild doe gently, her fingers drowning in the soft fur.\nThen, she suddenly turned her head and glanced at the sea, its surface rising and falling tumultuously.\n\nFar away, a sail appeared from beyond the horizon. A ship was approaching the island, struggling against the waves. The wind had brought a storm, and with it came the guests.\n\n***\n\nThree people disembarked from the ship - an old man, a warrior carrying a round shield, and a child with red hair. They made their way along the winding path and approached an old shrine.\nThe shrine was neither grand nor magnificent, but it emanated a feeling of solemn holiness.\nIts walls were built of white marble, with rose vines covering them like a cloak. An altar stood in front of the shrine, with fire burning in a stone bowl.\n\nThe old man made an offering to the altar, placing fresh grapes, leaves of laurel, and hawk feathers on its weathered surface. Finally, he burned incense in the bowl and stepped back, kneeling reverently on the ground.\nThe warrior stood behind him, leaning on his spear. The child, meanwhile, furtively reached his little hand to snatch the grapes. Shocked, the old man slapped the boy's hand away.\n'Auro!' The boy flinched away and stumbled, his lips trembling.\n'Let him have it.'\n\nThe woman's voice resounded from the other side of the altar. She appeared without making any noise, as if by magic.\nThe forest seemed more alive in her presence, and roses suddenly bloomed on the vines behind her.\nThe boy froze, looking at her with wide eyes. The old man lowered himself to the ground, while the warrior bowed deeply.\n'Why are you here?'\nThe old man straightened and glanced at the woman with awe.\n'My lady… I bring news of woe.' She regarded him silently, making the old man continue:\n'A Supreme Beast is rampaging on the northern borders of our kingdom. The Mountain Gate is no more, and several cities have already been ravaged. We've come to beseech you, as a hero, to defend our lands once more.'\nThe woman's gorgeous face remained expressionless.\n'Is there no warrior left in the kingdom to defeat a rampaging beast?'\nThe warrior glanced away in shame.\n\nThe old man, meanwhile, smiled wistfully.\n'There are those who can kill the beast, my lady. However, only you can stop its rampage without spilling blood.' The woman remained silent for a while, then turned away without saying a word and disappeared into the shrine.\n\nA few minutes later, she returned carrying a bow and a quiver of arrows, a leather bracer fastened on her forearm. The old man shifted and glanced at her with glee.\n'Our ship…'\nBut she simply shook her head.\n'No need.' She picked up a hawk's feather from the altar, glanced at it silently, and then threw it into the fire. A moment later, two wings like those of a hawk unfolded from her back, sunlight pouring through the brown feathers.\n\nThe woman fastened the quiver to her belt and stretched her wings, preparing to take flight. Before that, however, she lingered for a few seconds.\nTaking the grapes from the altar, she offered them to the boy, and then awkwardly patted him on the head.\n'Don't let your elders kneel in your stead, boy.' A second later, her graceful figure soared into the air. The boy was left on the ground, looking at the sky with wonder in his eyes.\n\n***\n\nA mountain chain lay in ruins.\nBeyond the broken cliffs and fractured land, pillars of smoke were rising into the sky from a devastated city.\nAnd on the plain in front of it…\n\nA huge boar lay on the ground, dead, a flood of crimson blood flowing from its wounds like a river. Its carcass was like a towering hill, and the woman who stood below it glanced like an ant in its shadow.\nHer quiver was empty, and her face was concerned.\nShe inhaled deeply, then grimaced, as if appalled by something.\n'Poison…'\n\nThe woman crouched faintly and leapt high into the air, landing on the dead beast's snout. She ascended its corpse like one would a mountain, eventually reaching the huge boar's vast back. There, hidden by the coarse fur, hundreds of great javelins bristled like a palisade, their metal corroded and covered in rust.\n\nThe woman grasped one of the javelins and pulled it out of the dеad beast's flesh, then studied it with a frown. A few seconds later, she frowned.\n'Imperial steel?'\nHer expression darkened.\n\nTurning north, she glanced at the crumbled mountains. Where a narrow mountain pass had been, now there was a wide valley. An impregnable gorge had turned into an open road.\nA shadow fell on the woman's clear eyes…\n\nAnd with that, Sunny found himself back in the Ash Castle. He gasped, then swayed faintly, disoriented for a moment.\n'What? What the…'\nWhich of his questions was this truth supposed to answer? He wanted to know how the world had ended, not how a strange woman had slain a rampaging Supreme Beast.\n\nAnd more than that…\n'Auro?! Auro of the damn Nine?!'\nNow that was a blast from the past.\nAs Sunny spat the name of the young imperial soldier he had killed once, in his First Nightmare, Slayer shifted faintly behind him. Turning around, he glanced at her veiled face, then studied her graceful figure.\n'That… that was a scene from your past, wasn't it?'\nSlayer tilted her head, looking at him expressionlessly.\n\nSunny stared at his Shadow for a few seconds, then glanced away.\n'Right. She doesn't know what truth was revealed to me, and on top of that, she doesn't even remember her own past.' And even if the truth Ariel's Game had shown him was about Slayer… technically, it was not her past. Because Slayer was not the woman from the vision he had been shown, but a Shadow Creature born from the woman's shadow instead, long after the woman died.\nStill…\n\nThere must have been a reason why Ariel's Vision had given him this truth, and not any other.\nThe scene must have been important, somehow.\nAs important as two daemons meeting in the middle of the Doom War.\n…If it was, however, Sunny had no idea why.\n\nHe took a few deep breaths, trying to suppress his frustration, then slowly regained his composure.\n'No… it's fine.' There were twelve more Snow Abominations for him to slay, and twelve more truths for him to uncover. One of those should hold the answer he sought."

    "content": "2337 Actionable Strategy\nThe sun was rolling toward the horizon, so Sunny and his companions left the dark interior оf the Ash Castle and scaled the slopes of the caldera once again. The pillar of smoke rising into the sky gave birth to billowing black clouds, and flakes of ash were falling down like snow.\nThe last volcano surrounded by snow-covered mountains from all sides, and their pristine white peaks loomed oppressively in the distance.\n\nWhile Kai and Slayer were preparing for battle, Sunny assessed his army. He had a Saint, a Transcendent Shadow, and two dozen Supreme shades at his disposal. Each individual Obsidian Wasp was powerful and lethal, but peculiarly enough, Kai and Slayеr - the Ash Beasts - were much more lethal than the shades despite their inferior Rank. And, naturally, there was Sunny himself - the Ash Tyrant.\nWith a sigh, Sunny drew the map of Ariel's Game in the ash again and studied it with a concerned expression.\nKai fastened the black quiver to the sash of his ivory armour and glanced at him questioningly.\n'You seem troubled?'\nSunny nodded slowly.\n'I am, a little. By now, we know a lot about how this realm works - enough to plan a strategy, at least. However, there are still two questions that are left unanswered. One of them is somewhat important, but the other one is vital.' He pointed to the map. 'First of all, while we have some idea what the Castles and the Shrines do, the special square at the very heart of the board is still a mystery. Much more importantly, though, we don't know if there is a difference between how figures move. For example, we don't know if some figures can move diagonally between the mountains or cross several peaks in one move.' He sighed. 'Well, if they can, there is no point in making strategies. We will be surrounded in no time, no matter what we try to do… then, it will just be a fight to the death.'\nHe glanced at the map and narrowed his eyes. 'If we assume that all figures can only move one square at a time, though… then, it is quite obvious what we must do.'\n\nOn the grid in front of him, the Snow Tyrant was guarded in the northern Castle by a Snow Demon and two Beasts. One Snow Devil guarded the center of the board, while the second one guarded the Eastern Shrine with two Monsters. Three Snow Beasts surrounded the Ash Castle, while the last Snow Demon was alone in the south-western corner.\nWhich meant that the Western Shrine was left unguarded.\nSunny pointed to it. 'We need to гeach that square, entrench ourselves, and kill as numerous enemies there as we can. The problem, naturally, is that the Snow Demon in the left corner can get to it much faster… oh, and that we are surrounded by Snow Beasts from all sides.' He smiled dаrkly.\n'So, we need to kill one of them before they attack us from all sides come dawn.'\nHe would have preferred to spare all three Snow Beasts to kill them later at the Shrine, but the situation left him with little choice. He had to break the blockade around the Ash Castle tonight, before the snow worm and the clockwork giant received a chance to attack the Ash Castle from west and east simultaneously.\nSo, the only real choice Sunny had was which of the three Snow Beasts to attack. Naturally, finishing off the Ice Hive was the easiest choice, which was not to say that it would be easy. That said, he would rather deal with one of the Cursed Ones first. Sadly, he could not.\nLaunching an attack on the mountain conquered by the ghastly worm would bring him too close to the Snow Demon in the far west, while challenging the fearsome giant would take him further away from the Western Shrine, well on his way to being caught by the group of Snow figures guarding the Eastern Shrine. So, only one choice remained.\nSunny glanced at the two Shrines, suddenly remembering the four words carved into each side of the jade board. Snow, Ash, Fear, Truth.\nSuddenly, he realized that the rune of Ash was carved just below the square where, as he knew now, the Ash Castle stood. The rune of Snow was directly opposite, under the square where the Snow Castle stood. The Shrine that the Snow Demon guarded… was it the Shrine of Fear, then? Which meant that the Shrine Sunny wanted to occupy was the Shrine of Truth.\nHe smiled. 'How fitting.'\n\nHis hair was disheveled, so he tied it back with a band made of shadows. Then, Sunny moved his shoulders, stretching them before the battle.\n'Prepare yourselves. We are going to wipe out the Ice Hive from existence today.'\nWhile somewhat unfortunate, it was not a bad choice. That way, at least, Sunny would gather more shades before facing the truly powerful Snow Abominations further down the line. Just as he spoke those words, the sun finally touched the distant horizon. Its radiance turned vibrant red, painting the sea of clouds with a thousand shades of scarlet, crimson, and carmine.\nIt was as if the lonesome mountains were rising from a sea of blood.\nThe volcano shook. Then, it roared, and the pillar of smoke rising from its depths swelled, growing wider and more voluminous. The clouds of ash above them boiled.\nA powerful wind blew from the south, scattering the ash and carrying it north, west, and east. Just as it had happened with the snow, the plumes of ash reached across the glowing red abyss of sunlit clouds, absorbing the intense radiance of the eventide. Soon enough, the tendrils of ash solidified into huge obsidian bridges, which glowed with the reflected light of the setting sun as if imbued with burning embers.\n\nIt was a pretty sight.\nSunny inhaled deeply, then commanded his troops forward.\n',Attack.''"

    "title": "2338 Dire Penalty.docx",
    "content": "2338 Dire Penalty\n\nSunny jumped down to the surface of the obsidian bridge, testing it carefully. The bridge was hundreds of metеrs across and dozens of kilometers long, arching gracefully above the glowing sea of crimson clouds. It was not monolithic, but rather an airy and ethereal structure of chaotically interwoven streams of obsidian that glanced far more fragile and delicate than it was supposed to be.\n\nIn truth, Sunny suspected that even if he had access to his full titanic strength, he would not be able to put a dent in the obsidian bridge. So, he did not have to worry about it collapsing beneath him.\nTurning into a shadow, he glided across the smooth obsidian with great speed. Sunlight burned in the depths of the volcanic glass like embers, and the winds howled above.\n\nKai and Slayer followed behind, escorted by the insect - like shades.\n\nHe could have carried them all to the distant mountain through the shadows, but there was a possibility that they had gotten the rules of Ariel's Game wrong, and that the being dwelling beneath the clouds would react negatively to the Ash Domain advancing. So, Sunny wanted to leave himself a chance to react and retreat in case that happened. Luckily, nothing of the sort transpired. This was good news for Sunny, since he planned to rely heavily on their ranged advantage when dealing with the Ice Hive.\n\nThe mountain was perforated by countless tunnels that formed a complicated network. Besieging the Crystal Wasps in their home would be quite a treacherous affair, so Sunny wanted to lure at least some of them out first.\n\nKai's new arrow was going to be of great help, in that regard. Since it could phase through solid matter, he could use it to wound the Snow Abominations while they were hiding in the depths of their ice fortress - enough so to send them into a rage, at least.\n\nSunny had half - expected that the Crystal Wasps would hurry to the surface themselves, forming a solar array to bombard the attackers with gigantic beams of incinerating light while they crossed the bridge, but that did not happen either. The nightmare creatures seemed quite comfortable waiting for the adversary in the depths of the Hive, where they had both the terrain and the numerical advantage.\n\nHowever, Sunny's plаn met a different obstacle. Just a few moments after stepping on the bridge, he suddenly emerged from the shadows and swayed, a strained expression on his face.\n\n'Ah… that feels awful.'\n\nHe expected that attacking a square of the Snow Domain would weaken him, just like the Cгystal Wasps had been weakened when attacking the Ash Castle. However, he did not know just how severe the penalty would be.\n\nSunny felt sapped of his vitality, frail and feeble, as if he had aged several decades in a single moment. His body was weakened, while his soul was frozen, the essence circulating sluggishly as the rate at which it was replenished fell drastically.\n\nBehind him, Kai staggered in the air, while Slayer came to an abrupt halt and slid across the obsidian surface, keeping her balance with the grace of a dancer. Her eyes remain cold and menacing, but her brow curved in a subtle scowl. Even the Obsidian Wasps seemed to slow down.\n\nSunny looked back, at the ashen slopes of the fuming volcano, wondering if the weakening hex would be removed if they returned. Kai and Slayer had already shown that they can hit targets on the distant mountain from the edge of the caldera, after all… so, crawling back to start a purely ranged assault was a possibility.\n\nIt was not a very good decision, though, because it would take Kai numerous hours to significantly reduce the number of enemies from that far, let alone to eradicate the Ice Hive completely - if that was even possible. And the time they had to conquer the snowy peak would run out as soon as the sun disappeared behind the horizon.\n\nSunny frowned. They were close to the middle of the obsidian bridge, just about to escape from under the clouds of ash and see a clear sky.\n\nLooking at Kai, he said evenly:\n\n'Kai, try wounding one of them from here.'\n\nThe charming аrcher landed on the glowing obsidian and retrieved the enchanted arrow from his quiver. The crystal arrowhead glistened as he nocked it on the string, and then…\n\nNothing happened.\n\nKai struggled with his bow for a few seconds, muttering something to himself, then lowered it with a complicated expression and looked at Sunny.\n\n'I… can't.'\n\nHe grimaced.\n\n'I can't draw my bow. It's too heavy.'\n\nSunny blinked a few times.\n\n'Curse it all.'\n\nSo that was what it meant to be suppressed by the Snow Domain, which spanned forty - eight out of forty - nine peaks of Ariel's Game. Or rather, that was what it meant to attack a mountain surrounded by the Snow Domain from all sides except for one.\n\nSunny sighed, knowing that his plan had gone belly up. He could potentially manipulate the black bow to make it easier to draw, but that would not help the situation - any weaker, and Kai would not even be able to scratch the Crystal Wasps, let alone kill them. Slayer was in a somewhat better position, but she was not going to be of great help either. Both of them were Transcendent, and weakened even further by the Snow Domain, facing scores of Great Beasts in battle would be a tall task for them.\n\n'I might have underestimated how important the role of the Domains is in this game.'\n\nSo… what was he supposed to do?\n\nKai seemed to be thinking the same.\n\n'What do we do, Sunny?'\n\nSunny remained silent for a few seconds, then looked at the distant mountain with a concerned expression. There was only one thing left to do, really. He smiled chillingly.\n\n'...You two make sure that none of them escape.'\n\nKai raised an eyebrow, confused.\n\n'Escape? Escape from what?'\n\nSunny took a step forward, summoning the helmet of the Jade Mantle. His low voice sounded even when he spoke.\n\n'...From me.'\n\nWith that, he suddenly disappeared, taking the Obsidian Wasps with him. Kai and Slayer were left alone on the bridge, bathed in the scarlet radiance of the setting sun.\n\nAlmost at the same time, the shadows within the Ice Hive stirred, surging forward, and a fearsome figure encased in an armor of inky - black jade stepped out of them, facing a rattled Crystal Wasp like an omen of death."

    "title": "2339 Invading the Ice Hive.docx",
    "content": "2339 Invading the Ice Hive\n\nSunny found himself in a cave made of ice.\n\nHis turbulent thoughts settled, giving way to the cold and tranquil state of battle clarity.\n\nThere were around fifty Crystal Wasps left in the Hive - each of them a Great Beast. The network of tunnels and caverns was their fortress, while Sunny was weakened as an invader into the Snow Domain. Each Nightmare Creature was more powerful than he was due to the rules of Ariel's Game, but that was a trifling matter.\nAfter all, Sunny had come this far by facing enemies who were much more powerful than him. Even if he had enjoyed the ultimate privilege of being the strongest monster on the battlefield as of late, the tenacity of a cunning killer was in his blood.\n\nThe Crystаl Wasps were mere Beasts - Great Beasts, but Beasts nonetheless. They were mindless death machines that only knew the frenzied madness of bloodlust. His intelligence was a deadlier weapon, so he was not too concerned about his diminished power.\n\nTheir great numerical advantage was a more pressing threat. Even though the tunnels of the Ice Hive were somewhat narrow, Sunny knew that he could be easily overwhelmed here.\n\nHe had his shades, naturally, but they would simply be torn to shreds if he unleashed them immediately - after all, there were faг fewer of them than there were Crystal Wasps at the moment, and they were being weakened by the Snow Domain as well.\n\nThat said, Sunny was in a far better situation than he had been on the Forgotten Shore. Not because he had become infinitely more powerful - his enemies had as well - but because there were more tools at his disposal.\nHe was going to destroy the Ice Hive by using his mind, his versatility, and his superior skill.\n\nHis shadow sense spread into the depths of the mountain, enveloping every corner of the enormous hive. In a heartbeat, he perceived and fathomed every tunnel, every intersection, and every cаvern hidden in the ice.\n\nHe also perceived the location of every Crystal Wasp guarding the frozen fortress.\n\nSome were gathered in vast caverns in groups, waiting. Some were patrolling the tunnels alone or in pairs. Some were busy preparing the fortress for the attack. Sunny did not sense any traps, but he did discover a complicated system оf crystal chimes that answered to the smallest movement of air, and would therefore notify the Crystal Wasps if an intruder disturbed their dwelling.\n\nBecause of it, the Ice Hive was permeated by a delicate, melodious tinkling.\n\nSunny smiled.\n\nIn the next moment, the shadows all across the network of tunnels surged and rose. The shadows did not attempt to wound or kill the Crystal Wasps - instead, they merely turned into solid walls of obsidian, blocking off myriad tunnels.\n\nThe abominations instantly stirred, moving to destroy the obstructions; however, even with their great power, destroying the solid mass of mystical obsidian was going to take some time… especially because it kept repairing itself.\nSunny did not just block the tunnels randomly. Each obstacle was placed strategically, and for a single purpose - he wanted to isolate the Crystal Wasps from each other.\n\nTo kill them one by one.\n\nAfter all, even though Sunny was disadvantaged in terms of power, he also possessed some advantages. Among them, two stood out the most - his awareness… and his mobility.\n\n'Let's start.'\n\nBy then, the Crystal Wasp in front of him - a solitary seeker of the Ice Hive - was already lunging forward.\n\nSunny might not have been faster than a Great Beast supported by the Snow Domain, but he was a warrior. The Crystal Wasp, meanwhile… was nothing more than a pest.\n\nThe black odachi was already turning into a long pike. Sunny slammed its butt into the ground and braced it with his leg, turning himself so heavy that the ice beneath his feet began to crack. He channeled his Will into the blade of the pike, commanding it to pierce the adversary, and into its shaft, commanding it to remain whole.\n\nThen, he commanded himself to hold.\n\nThe Great Beast was flying at him at spectacular speed, so it had no time to stop. Its own momentum impaled the Nightmare Creature on the pike, the impregnable crystal carapace shattering as the black blade pierced its chest and exited through the crack between the thorax and the abdomen.\n\nNaturally, the malevolent Wasp was still alive, straining to push its body along the pike's length to rip Sunny apart.\n\nHe strained his muscles, raising his weapon… and the massive Abomination impaled on it. Then, with a hiss, Sunny thrust the pike upward with all his might and pinned the Nightmare Creature to the tunnel's ceiling.\n\nBefore the Wasp could shatter the shaft of the manifested weapon and free itself, seven black spikes shot from the ground like pillars, obliterating its body and causing the tunnel to collapse.\n\n[You have slain an adversary.]\n\n…Sunny was already someplace else.\n\nStepping through the shadows, he apрeared on the opposite side of the Ice Hive, deep inside the mountain, in a small cave where another solitary Crystal Wasp was digesting the remains of its fallen kin. Those of the abominations who had escaped the previous battle with grievous wounds were mercilessly devoured by the less damaged Beasts to mend their wounds.\n\nThe Ice Hive seemed to operate according to the principles of ruthless practicality.\n\nSunny did not have time to observe how the Crystal Wasps turned their food into crystalline liquid and how they used that liquid to heal and strengthen themselves - manifesting a sword out of shadows, he severed one of the Nightmare Creature's legs at the joint and danced away from its retaliation.\n\nThe rest was simply a matter of technique and swordsmanship.\n\nDespite the Great Beast's superior size and physical might, Sunny rapidly crippled it, thus reducing its agility, and then beheaded the creature with a precise strike.\n\n[You have slain…]\n\n'That's two.'\n\nHe was gone by the time the corpse of the Nightmare Creature hit the ground.\n\n'Forty-nine to go.'"

    "title": "2340 Conquering Tyrant.docx",
    "content": "2340 Conquering Tyrant\n\nSunny began with the Crystal Wasps who had been caught in his shadow maze alone. The obsidian barriers he had erected were strong, but not as strong as they would have been outside the Snow Domain - the enraged Great Beasts would destroy them sooner rather than later, so he had to act rapid.\n\nHis hunt was rapid and brutal.\n\nUsing Shadow Step to instantly move between distant areas of the Ice Hive, he picked the stragglers off one by one. His combat skill and indomitable killing intent were more than enough to slay the fearsome crystal abominations, even if clashing with so numerous Great Beasts in quick succession was rapidly depleting his stamina.\n\nIn a narrow tunnel, Sunny severed a menacing Crystal Wasp in two with a razor-sharp odachi, and then pierced its head through the eye when the upper half of the Nightmare Creature kept crawling at him in a murderous frenzy.\n\nIn an ice cave where drops of water were falling into a vast and clear pool from a forest of crystal stalactites, he kept another Great Beast at a distance with a spear for a few seconds, then found an opening and split its abdomen open with a vicious strike. Its head shattered under his boot a second later.\n\nIn a passage so narrow that a single Crystal Wasp could barely fit inside, Sunny closed the distance to a frenzied Great Beast, diving past its scythe-like legs, tore its carapace open with the gauntlets of the Jade Mantle, and shattered the delicate flesh beneath with his fists. The melodious sound of wind chimes was drowned out by the clangor of battle, thunderous thunderclaps, and the loud ringing of shattering crystal.\nBy the time Sunny was done dealing with the solitary Nightmare Creatures, he was faintly out of breath. The entire slaughter had taken him no more than a couple minutes, and he had never stopped moving, seamlessly stepping between the shadows as if the sequence of brutal clashes was one uninterrupted battle.\n\n'Thirty-seven to go.'\n\nThat was how many Crystal Wasps there were left in the Ice Hive. Sadly, things were going to get harder from now on - the rest of them were grouped together, and as he dealt with smaller groups, the larger ones would break through the shadow barriers and fuse.\n\nBut that was alright.\n\nBecause by killing the solitary abominations, Sunny had made sure thаt the number of his shades swelled. It had to swell a little more, though.\n\n'Fourteen more will do.'\n\nFourteen Great Beasts, such a trifle!\n\nWincing as if in pain, he assumed the form of the Shadowspawn and dove into the shadows, holding a black odachi in each of his two pairs of hands.\n\nShooting from the darkness in a large vertical cavern, he jumped onto the wall and ran up its icy length, his claws sinking into the hard ice. Dim, diffused light was streaming from somewhere far above, and the two Crystal Wasps waiting on the wall instantly moved, rushing down to obliterate him. Because of where the source of light was located, their long shadows reached Sunny before the nightmare creatures themselves could. He slashed at their shadows with both of his swords, causing the Wasps to let out ear-piercing screeches and fall down, crashing into the distant floor of the cavern while convulsing in agony - by the time they recovered enough to move again, he already plummeted down and shattered one with the unbearable weight of his body. There was a deafening boom, and the floor of the cavern cracked as a cloud of ice paгticles and crystal shards rose into the air. A split second later, Sunny emerged from the mass of pulverized ice, his two swords lashing out to pierce the vital points of the remaining Nightmare Creature.\n\n[You have slain…]\n\nHe dove into the shadows, carrying the twitching corpse with him. Emerging in a cave where two more Crystal Wasps were furiously attacking an obsidian wall, he tossed the corpse at one of them and attacked the other.\n\n[You have slain.]\n\nAnd so it went.\n\n'Ah… I'm tired…'\n\nEven at this breakneck speed, Sunny felt nervous that he would not be able to slaughter the entire Hive before the sun disappeared behind the horizon.\n\nWhat would happen if the Ash Domain's move came to an end before the Snow figure protecting the square was slain? Considering how hastily the Crystal Wasps retreated from the volcano in the morning… nothing Sunny would want to learn.\n\nSoon enough, he ran out of pairs of nightmare creatures to kill. His lungs were burning, and his heart - both of them, since he was still in the Shadowspawn form - were beating wildly. There were a few cracks on the Jade Mantle, and a few hideous cuts on his body.\n\nHe did not bleed, naturally, but the insidious cold was seemingly seeping under his skin, making him feel even weaker.\n\n'Damn it…'\n\nSunny let out a low growl.\n\nBy then, the obsidian barriers had already fallen, and the remaining Wasps - more than twenty of them - gathered in a vast cavern, ready to rush like a crystal avalanche to find and destroy the intruder. But Sunny did not make them wait.\n\nInstead, he stepped into the shadows one last time and emerged in the cavern, looking at the two dozen nightmare creatures from behind the vizor of his jade helmet.\n\n…It felt quite unnerving, to say the least, to be stared down by a swarm of Great Beasts.\n\n'Who are you to dare stare me down, Beasts, no, forget it. There's no time for that!'\n\nSunny grinned.\n\n'That should be enough.'\n\nWith that, he turned into a shadow.\n\nAnd from that shadow, a torrent of ash rolled like a billowing cloud, splitting into helical strands to envelop the swarm of Crystal Wasps.\n\nA moment later, the ash solidified into Obsidian Wasps - close to fifty of them, against two dozen Great Beasts.\n\nTwo for each Nightmare Creature left in the Ice Hive.\n\nSunny assumed a tangible form once more, abandoning the towering body of the Shadowspawn in favor of his own speedy and slender body.\n\nHis smile was cold and cruel.\n\n'Didn't I say it? Death is inevitable.'\n\nHis Obsidian Wasps rushed forward, and he lunged at the nearest Nightmare Creature as well.\n\n…Before too long, the Ice Hive was no more, each of its crystalline inhabitants becoming a soldier in his growing army."

    "title": "2341 Cloud of Ash.docx",
    "content": "2341 Cloud of Ash\nThe floor of the cavern was littered with fragments of shattered crystal. Sunny had recalled the Obsidian Wasps back into the dark depths of his soul and dismissed his helmet, inhaling the frigid air deeply. Now that the sounds of the slaughter had ceased, the melodious tinkling of the crystal wind chimes permeated the silence once more.\n\nHe exhaled slowly, knowing that the soothing melody would be erased from existence before too long, as well. 'Not bad, for my first move.' He had taken one of the Snow figures off the board.\nTaking a few steps forward, shards of crystal crunching under his feet, Sunny used the blade of his odachi to sweep some of them away. This was where he had killed the last of the Crystal Wasps, and so…'There.'\n\nCrouching, he reached down and picked up a jade figurine from beneath the shards. It was the Snow Beast figure - one representing the Ice Hive. Sunny studied it for a few seconds, then hid it inside his armor.\nThen, with no more time to waste, he stepped through the shadows and returned to the cave where water was flowing into a deep pool from a forest of crystal stalactites. Manifesting a large cauldron, he hastily filled it with clear water and pulled it into the shadows, appearing on the slopes of the snowy mountain a few seconds later.\n\nKai and Slayer were already waiting for him there, the last rays of the setting sun painting their silhouettes with fiery shades of scarlet. Sunny offered them a friendly smile and brought some water to his lips, drinking greedily. 'Ah,' 'I guess it's not poisoned.'\nThen, he raised an eyebrow. 'What?' Kai had been staring at him with wide eyes.\n\nThe charming archer shook his head slowly. 'N - no, nothing. It's just… they were Great Beasts. All… all fifty of them…' His gaze could penetrate solid rock, so he must have seen exactly how Sunny had dealt with the Crystal Wasps.\nSunny grinned. 'Were they? An expected result, then. It would be a shame if I couldn't do this much as a Supreme, after all, I killed my first Great Devil as a Sleeper!'\n\nFinally, he found a chance to work this one in! Kai's eyes shook. …And a moment later, the mountain shook, as well.\nSunny sighed, then glanced at his friend languidly. 'I suggest you brace yourself.'\n\nKai frowned. 'Brace myself? For wh…' Just then, the sun finally disappeared behind the horizon, and the peak of the mountain exploded with a deafening roar. A towering pillar of smoke and ash rose into the sky, expanding into a mushroom cloud.\nSunny remained nonchalant as a great fireball bloomed behind him, and a wave of scorching wind broke against his back. 'For that.'\nThe mountain shook and shook, as if convulsing. Its entire peak was obliterated by the explosion, stone shrapnel and jagged boulders raining from above. A billowing mass of ash was expelled into the sky and spread, obscuring it like a veil of billowing darkness. Great plates of snow were dislodged and slid down, turning into destructive avalanches…\nThen, the slope of the mountains split, and a flood of luminous lava flowed from its shattered peak, evaporating the snow. Sunny watched the obsidian bridges turn into torrents of ash as he erected a bulwark of shadows higher on the slope, making the lava flow past the narrow stretch of rock where he, Kai, and Slayer stood.\n\nHe gestured to the cauldron. 'How about a drink to celebrate our victory?' Kai gave him a long look, then scooped some water and drank deeply.\nBefore too long, the snowy mountain was gone, replaced by a fuming volcano. The peak had turned into a vast caldera. The snow melted, revealing weathered rock, and the rock was covered by a layer of falling ash…\nThe network of tunnels created by the Crystal Wasps had been destroyed entirely. Most of the tunnels collapsed, while those that remained were now filled with cooled magma.\nNight fell, submerging the artificial realm of Ariel's Game in darkness.\n\nIf there was one flaw to the newly established volcano, it was that there was no fortress here for them to hide from the falling ash. So, instead, Sunny created a simple house out of manifested shadows, complete with a few items of crude furniture. There was a desk, a few chairs, and a bed. He even manifested a blanket and a couple of pillows. He did not need to sleep just yet, but Kai could probably use a bit of proper rest.\n\nSo, Sunny sent the charming archer to bed and sat at the desk, creating more arrows for him. Slayer stayed outside, guarding their makeshift home… even though they had never been as safe as they were here, in Ariel's Game, for as long as the sun was hidden behind the horizon. 'I wonder what they'll do at dawn?'\nSunny had hoped that the Snow Worm and the Clockwork Giant would move to conquer the Ash Castle, but now that he thought about it, that was pointless. After all, the special nature of Castles was that the squares they stood upon never changed color. So, they could not be truly conquered.\n\nThat meant that the two Snow Beasts would probably pursue him north. 'Will we have to fight one or both of them to reach the Shrine?' That would be unfortunate, since Sunny wanted to kill them as a sacrifice to Ariel's Game.\nHe briefly considered tossing the figure of the Snow Beast in his possession into the vent of the newly created volcano, but decided аgainst it in the end. There was no altar in front of the main vent here, so he would probably not receive a revelation by doing so.\n\nIn the morning, the rising sun turned snow into glass bridges again. Sunny, Kai, and Slayer watched the Clockwork Giant walk across one to the Ash Castle, while the Snow Worm crawled back to the mountain where its nest had been, directly west of the newly created volcano.\nSunny sighed. They were boxed in, soon to be corralled. The Snow Worm blocked the way west, while moving east would lead them away from the Western Shrine. That only left the northern direction…\n\nBut if there, after one move, they would be surrounded by two Snow Beasts from west and south… and a Snow Devil from the north.\nHe winced. 'What a bother.'"

    "title": "2342 Divine Whims.docx",
    "content": "2342 Divine Whims\nThere was a long time to go before sunset, so the three of them were stuck on the newborn volcano for now. Sunny spent about an hour turning the shadow house into a shadow manor, purely for his own amusement. The elegant edifices rose and fell, changing style. Wings were added to the main building; a bell tower rose from the ground, the bell ringing loudly as it was assaulted by the wind.\n\nAfter a while, there was even a semblance of garden, perched precariously on the steep slope of the volcano. The bushes, the trees, and the flowers were all inky-black and intricate, but devoid of life.\n\nSunny sat in front of a flower bed full of black roses for a long time, staring at them intently. Eventually, one of the roses slowly changed, its petals swelling with a vibrant red color.\n\nColor was another property of matter, after all. When light shined on an object, some of it was absorbed, and some of it was reflected - the reflected light was what humans perceived as color. Sunny had never attempted to form the manifested shadows to absorb and reflect light in a specific manner, but nothing really prevented him from trying.\nHe had successfully turned the shadow rose red after experimenting for a while. Funnily enough, changing the color of a single flower had been more difficult, and strained him more, than building the entire manor.\n\nBoth the manor and the rose were destined to be destroyed in no more than a day, when the volcano was conquered by the Snow Domain. Their beauty was fleeting, and would be gone in an instant…\n\nBut possibly that was what made art truly precious. Its evanescent nature.\n\nSunny had never deemed himself an artist, but at that moment, he thought that possibly being able to create something breathtaking was not too bad.\nHe studied the red rose for a few minutes, then shook his head and made it turn black once again.\nBlack flowers suited his taste better.\nEven knowing that his black garden would be swallowed by ice and snow come tomorrow, Sunny still made it permanent - partially in defiance of that inevitability, partially out of a peculiar hope that it would survive against all odds.\n\n'It's truly remarkable.'\nTurning his head, Sunny glanced at Kai, who had approached him at some point. There was an expression of wonder on the charming archer's face, prompting Sunny to raise an eyebrow.\n'What is?'\nKai hesitated for a few seconds, then gestured around them.\n'This. The trees, the flowers, the manor… just appearing out of nowhere on your whim. They say that Supremacy is like taking a half-step into godhood. It all sounded like mere words to me before, but now… now, I am starting to understand what a demigod is.'\nSunny smiled faintly.\n'Possibly that's because all the Supremes you've met before were half-devils, at best, instead of half-gods.'\nHe sighed and then rose from the ground, turning away from the black roses.\n'What do you think being Supreme means?'\nKai considered his question for a few seconds.\n'A Supreme is someone who rules. Someone who carries responsibility for their subjects, and is powerful enough to bear the weight of that responsibility. Someone whose soul is vast enough to encompass the world, thus becoming a Domain… a Sovereign.'\nSunny smiled and shook his head.\n'No. A Supreme is simply someone who is daring enough to reshape the world according to their whims.'\nHe patted Kai on the shoulder.\n'You are bound to become Supreme yourself, onе day soon. So, I suggest you start daring.'\nKai stared at him blankly for a bit, which made Sunny sigh.\n'Stop being afraid of your own power, Kai. Embrace it.'\nHis friend frowned and lingered for a while.\n\nEventually, he asked:\n'Even if it turns me into a monster?'\nSunny chuckled.\n'Especially if it turns you into a monster. How else are you going to survive in this appalling world, let alone change it?'\nInhaling deeply, he headed for the manor. His short second of rest was over, and he had to get back to weaving.\nAs Sunny walked away, Kai suddenly asked:\n'Is that what you did?'\nSunny halted his steps, smiled wistfully, and then continued walking.\n'Of course. Countless times over.'\nKai remained silent for a bit, then shook his head.\n'Well, I disagree. I don't think that becoming a monster is something to be proud of. So, I refuse.'\nSunny grinned.\n'Says a guy who killed a dragon, and is now himself a dragon!'\nHe kept that thought to himself, though. Instead, he gave Kai a thumbs-up.\n'What a daring thing to say. Keep it up!'\nWith that, Sunny disappeared behind the door of the manor, leaving the charming archer alone.\nWell… alone, being watched by Slayer.\nThe murderous shadow was sharpening her swords on a piece of stone - a completely unnecessary thing to do, considering the sublime materials from which they had been crafted - while observing the two of them silently.\nThere was no particular emotion in her inky-black eyes, but the measured movement of a blade across the surface of the stone slowed down for a moment.\n\nIn the evening, they crossed the obsidian bridge and conquered another mountain in the north. From there, they could see the fourth row of Ariel's Game… and the central square of the board, where a Snow Devil was waiting for them, protecting it.\nSunny had expected to see another mountain… but he could not have been more wrong.\nAs he, Kai, and Slayer stood on the slope of another newborn volcano, their expressions were a little odd.\nSunny blinked a couple of times.\n'What the hell?'\nIn front of them, far in the distance, a huge tree stood where a mountain was supposed to be. Its roots were hidden beneath the sea of clouds, and its branches seemed to support the sky, spanning countless kilometers across.\nKai glanced at Sunny, dumbfounded.\n'I'm… not seeing things, am I? How can such an enormous tree exist?'\nSunny nodded slowly, unable to look away from the fantastical view.\n'No, you're not. And indeed… that is one humongous tree.'\nHe shook his head in disbelief and said, his voice full of wonder:\n'I mean, it's almost as large as a single branch of the largest tree I've ever seen…'"

    "content": "2343 Game of the World Tree\nKai was so stunned that he did not even react to that last statement. The three of them simply remained still for a while, observing the magnificent sight of the enormous tree.\n\nThe bark of the tree was dark, while its branches were bare and shrouded in snow. Its branches were like a frozen nebula, while the tree itself was like the axis of the world, rising above the sea of clouds much higher than even the surrounding mountains. Sunny could not see its roots, but he suspected that it was at least ten times taller than the Soul Devourer had been at its peak.\nOf course, it was still infinitely smaller than the inconceivable tree whose stump he had witnessed at the heart of the Burned Forest.\n\nEventually, Kai exhaled and said slowly:\n'It's like I'm looking at a world tree.'\nSunny shook his head.\n'I've seen the actual world tree once. It is located north of the Forgotten Shore, and all that remains of it is an unfathomably enormous stump. This one… well, maybe it's a sapling of the world tree.'\n\nHe studied the tree for a while, then said with a hint of doubt in his voice:\n'Perhaps it is. We don't really know what this miniature realm is made of, and if these mountains are even real. But if this tree is indeed real and is a child of the Heart God's world tree, then it might very well be the thing that holds this entire realm together. Ariel might have used it as the core of his game's world.'\nThere was no evidence to prove his theory, really, but Sunny was inclined to believe it.\n\nBut even if he was wrоng, just to be safe…\n'Whatever you do, Kai, don't look inside that tree.'\nThe charming archer raised an eyebrow.\n'Why?'\nSunny hesitated for a moment.\n'If it really is the central element of this world's structure, then it might very well be the source of the being beneath the clouds… or at least connected to it. Who knows what slithers deep inside that enormous trunk? You might see something that your mind can't endure.'\nKai shivered.\n\nSunny studied the tree a bit more, then scratched his head.\n'It does make me wonder, though. Currently, it's shrouded in snow. How the hell will it become covered in ash if we conquer it? A tree can't erupt with lava, can it?'\nHe chuckled.\nWould it bloom if it was conquered by the Ash Domain? Or would it literally spew molten rock?\nThe latter was not impossible. Considering the size of the giant tree, its roots could very well stretch wide and deep enough to reach the mantle of this artificial world, or maybe even its molten core… if it even had those.\n\nIn any case, Sunny was more interested in something else.\n'There was a Snow Devil guarding the central square on the jade board. Can you see it?'\nKai glanced into the distance.\nHe remained silent for a while, then hurriedly glanced down.\n'Yes. I think so.'\nSunny sighed.\n'So, what kind of horror is it this time? A bestial monstrosity with rotting flesh? An eerie, creepy wraith? No, don't tell me… it's some kind of insect, isn't it? Damnation! Why does it always have to be insects?'\nKai lingered for a moment, then shook his head.\n'No. It… it looks like a human to me.'\nSunny frowned.\n'A human? No, wait. Is it human, or does it look for a human?'\nKai lingered with the answer.\n'I'm not sure. That Devil, he's just sitting there with his legs crossed. But I can't really discern any details, just… I think that he glanced back at me, too.'\nSunny considered the new information silently.\nDevils were sentient, intelligent, and cunning. They also wielded unholy powers, much like Awakened wielded Aspect Abilities. More importantly, this particular Devil was either Great… or Cursed. The former was tolerable, but the latter was truly bad news.\n\nAt that moment, Kai suddenly added:\n'There is… something peculiar about that Devil. I am not sure what it is, but I think I saw something behind him, like a string that glistened for a short second. In fact I had the same feeling when looking at the other Snow Abominations we faced, as well. All оf them are a bit peculiar.'\nSunny gave him a dark look.\n'Hey, I am already on edge, so there's no need to say creepy things to scare me even more, okay?'\nThe moon was rising above the sea of clouds, and the snow-covered branches of the enormous tree shone in its pale light.\nHe sighed.\n'Damn it.'\n'Anyway. Be prepared to fight that thing, whatever it is.'\n\nThis next dawn was going to be a perilous one for them. The Snow Worm and the Clockwork Giant were still two moves away, but the Snow Devil could attack the newborn volcano in one-meaning that it could attack them in the morning.\nAs long as it was willing to… commanded to?\nSunny still did not know what level of control the Snow Tyrant had over the other Snow figures. It was in the nature of Nightmare Creatures to attack beings whose souls were devoid of Corruption in a murderous frenzy, but if the Tyrant was in control of these abominations, then it could suppress their demented, overwhelming desire for a while.\nAfter all, Sunny was the Ash Tyгant, and he was accompanied by two Ash Beasts. They had already shown their ability to eliminate Snow figures, so the Snow Tyrant could show reluctance to send its Devil into battle alone.\nThey would just have to wait and see.\nAnd so, they did.\n\nIn the morning, as the sun rose above the horizon and illuminated the sea of clouds with radiant golden light, ethereal glass bridges connected the volcano to the surrounding mountains once more, and to the enormous tree, as well.\nBehind them, the volcano they had left yesterday was conquered by the Clockwork Giant and was covered by snow once again. To the left, the Snow Worm crawled to a new pеak and coiled around it, blocking the way west.\nAnd the Snow Devil…\nRemained where he was, not in a hurry to attack.\nSunny cursed quietly.\n\nIt was good news that they would not have to fight the Devil today. However, it was also terrible news, because all clues pointed to the fact that the Snow Tyrant was capable not only of controlling the Snow figures, but also of doing it strategically.\nHe grimaced and glanced away from the snow-covered tree, his eyes turning a few shades darker.\n'We are going to kill that grotesque worm in the evening. Get ready.'\nIt seemed that he would finally slay his first Cursed Beast."

    "title": "2344 Nature of the Beast.docx",
    "content": "2344 Nature of the Beast\nThere were a few minutes left before sunset. Sunny, Kai, and Slayer were on the slope of the volcano, waiting for the obsidian bridges to span the vast divide between them and the mountain where the Snow Worm lay in wait. Sunny was calm, while Slayer was her usual malevolent self. Kai, however, seemed worried. Watching him count his arrows for the tenth time, Sunny sighed.\n\n'That worm is a Beast. Which means that it is huge, strong - and dumb. Dealing with a dumb beast is not that difficult… however, it is also of the Cuгsed Rank. Which means that it is a lesser god. I know that you are a spеcialist in killing dragons, Kai, but have you ever killed a god?' The charming archer slowly shook his head. 'No. Have you?' Sunny chuckled. 'Not really. I did kill a dead god once, though.' Kai took a deep breath, prompting Sunny to smile. 'It was a minor god, and the Shadow Realm did most of the job. I only dealt it the last blow.' He paused for a moment, then shrugged. 'I have yet to slay a Cursed Beast, but in normal circumstances, it would not have been too big of a problem. Sadly, I am severely weakened by the current circumstances. So, we will have to really apply ourselves today. If we don't kill that thing before night comes, we'll probably die.' They did not simply have to kill the Snow Worm - they had to kill it before the sun disappeared behind the horizon. If they failed to slay the Cursed Beast in time, they would have to retreat to the volcano. And if they did, all three Snow Abominations would attack them come dawn - two Cursed Beasts and a Devil of unknown Rank. Defeat was not guaranteed, but Sunny did not count their chances of repelling all three nightmare creatures high. He smiled. 'I did watch good old Anvil fight a Cursed Tyrant once, though. So, I know a thing or two about fighting gods.' Sunny considered his words for a moment. 'Fighting a god, lesser or otherwise, is different from fighting any other Nightmare Creature. That is because gods exist outside the boundary of absolute laws that govern all of existence. They are not free from them, but… let's just say that they have more liberty in interpreting how these laws work, as applied to them. What I mean to say is that the existence of deities, from the point of view of us mortals, is inherently irrational.'\n\nHe shook his head. 'That… is a long way to say that when we engage the Snow Worm, you should not be surprised when weird things start to happen.' Kai chuckled. 'Weird things? Oh, I think I have developed a high tolerance to weirdness… after spending some time with you, I mean. I guess you truly are a demigod, Sunny! In more ways than just one.' Sunny gave him an oblivious look. 'Huh? What do you mean? Me, weird?' Kai blinked a couple of times. ',Forget I said anything.' He remained silent for a bit, then spoke again: 'I am curious, though. You and Nephis… you want to become Sacred yourselves, don't you?' Sunny was a little surprised by the question. He shrugged. 'I am not sure that it is something that we want. Rather, it is a means to an end. It's something that we have to do.' Kai smiled. 'Doesn't that mean that, soon enough, you will become inherently irrational, too? Aren't you afraid?' Sunny scratched the back of his head. 'Well. I haven't thought about the issue from that point of view, before.' He hesitated. 'But… yes. I am a bit afraid. Actually, I am very afraid. Of what I will become, and what I won't be anymore.' He remained silent for a while, then shrugged. 'But I have some experience with that. Becoming something new and leaving some of myself behind, I mean. I am not sure if I should say this, but… did you know? Actually…' Sunny glanced at Kai somberly. ',You may not believe it, but I haven't always been this good - looking.' Kai stared at him. 'Uh…' Sunny gave him a solemn nod. 'Indeed. I know it's hard to believe, but if anyone can, it's you. After all, you can sense when people tell lies.' Kai cleared his throat. 'I see. So… correct me if I am wrong… but are you saying that you becoming attractive is a change of the same magnitude as someone mortal becoming a god?' Sunny stared at him with indignation. 'I am definitely not!' 'That bastard!' But at least Kai wasn't counting his arrows anymore. Instead, he shook his head and laughed quietly. 'For what it's worth, I doubt you'll lеave a lot of yourself behind even if you do become a deity, Sunny. I am not sure how to describe it, but… you seem like someone who will always be himself, no matter the circumstances.'\n\nSunny smiled. Then, he frowned. 'Are you, perchance, implying that I am already so weird that becoming any weirder will be impossible?' Kai coughed. 'No, naturally not! I definitely… was not implying that…' Sunny grinned. 'Good, good. Because if you had… I was going to take it as a challenge.' Just then, the sun finally touched the horizon, and the volcano they were standing on spat out a billowing cloud of ash. Soon enough, a bridge of glossy obsidian connected the ashen slope to the distant mountain, glowing in the scarlet radiance of the dying sun. Sunny smiled. 'Let's hurry. You know what they say… the early bird gets the worm!' He jumped down to the surface of the bridge, utterly appalled by himself. 'Gods… what the hell did I just say? Did I really say that?' The early bird gets the worm?! It seemed that hanging out with Kai so much after being deprived of the charming archer's company for so long was having a negative impact on his sanity. That joke was truly, unforgivably terrible, worthy of being spoken by that despicable old fool, Jest. The last thing Sunny wanted was to resemble Jest in any shape or form. Groaning inwardly, he rushed forward. He had to kill a Cursed Beast, and he had to do it quickly."

    "title": "2345 Infinity and Finality.docx",
    "content": "2345 Infinity and Finality\nAs Sunny ran across the surface of the obsidian bridge, his figure turning into a dark blur, Kai and Slayer drew their bows. A moment later, black arrows streaked across thе sea of clouds and fell, piercing thе Snow Worm's pale flesh.\n\nOut there on the slopes of the volcano, they were still within the bounds of the Ash Domain. Therefore, they could exert their full power - granted, their power was not great enough to seriously wound a Cursed Beast.\n\nThe Snow Worm was so enormous that it was difficult to miss it. At the same time, its body was so vast that their arrows were no different from tiny needles, dealing almost no harm to the Nightmare Creature.\n\nBut that was alright, because Sunny did not need them to harm the Cursed Beast. Instead, they had to play a different, vitally important role in the opening act of the battle - instead of quality, it was the quantity of their attacks that mattered.\nThey had to sink as numerous arrows as they could into the Snow Worm, and do it as rapidly as possible.\n\nThat was because the arrows they were shooting were quite special - Sunny had crafted them himself, after all.\n\nIn the past few days, he had been observing the Snow Worm carefully. He still did not know a lot about the Cursed Beast, but he was certain that it wielded the concept of infinity as a weapon.\nIts pale body could grow endlessly, devouring as much space as the Snow Worm wanted. It could become dozens of kilometers long, or shrink to merely a few hundred meters. Naturally, that also made the Snow Worm nearly indestructible - after all, no matter how much of its huge body Sunny destroyed, the Beast could simply produce more….\nAnd more, and more, and more, until the entire mountain was buried under its pale flesh.\n\nSo, there were two ways to kill the bizarre godbeast. One way was to destгoy its rotten soul, which Sunny could achieve by focusing on attacking its shadow. The other was to suppress its power, somehow… but naturally, Sunny did not have to pick just one strategy.\nHe could very well implement both, and the arrows were meant to accomplish the latter.\n\nHe had been crafting the arrows to subdue the Snow Worm for the last two days, and had made quite a few of them. The enchantment woven into the jagged crystal arrowheads was based оn one of the Memories he had crafted for Rain in Godgrave - [In Case of Emergency].\nThe purpose of that enchantment was to lock something in space, which was supposed to save her in case the veil of clouds above Godgrave unexpectedly broke. Now, Sunny was not too knowledgeable about these matters, but he was pretty sure that the concept of infinity was innately connected to the concept of space.\n\nAt least it was in the context of the Snow Storm, which existed as a living being that could potentially occupy an infinite amount of space.\nSo, if its body was pinned to space by the enchanted arrows Sunny created, its ability to grow endlessly was going to be compromised - either suppressed or at least interfered with.\n\nThat was the plan, at least.\n\nKai and Slayer did not have to aim that hard to hit the huge Cursed Beast, but there was another challenge facing them. They had to fire off all the Finality Arrows Sunny had provided them rapidly, which put great strain on their bodies - the draw wеights of their bows were nothing short of startling, after all.\n\nSunny would have loved to stay and enjoy the awesome display of extreme athleticism, but he had his own task to accomplish.\nWhile the role of his companions was to debilitate the adversary, he had to actually kill it.\n…While not getting killed, naturally.\n\nFighting a Cursed Beast while only having access to one seventh of his power felt like a bad idea. But, at the same time…\nIt was just a Cursed Beast.\nIt was just an Nightmare Creature one Rank above him. So what was there to feel worried about?\n\nAs the arrows pierced the Snow Worm's flesh, the Nightmare Creature moved. The coils of pale flesh that enveloped the mountain shifted, and its enormous head rose above the peak, opening a gigantic maw to let out a low, eerie, horrifying wail.\nSunny could not describe it with words, really - it did not resemble any sound that a living being was supposed to be able to produce at all. Rather, it seemed like something that an elemental force would sound like, sending shivers running down his spine.\nBefore the obliterating wave of sound could fully hit him, tearing his flesh apart, Sunny dove into the shadows and hid in their depths, allowing for the worm's wail to pass above him. But even in the dark embrace of shadows, he felt his very essence tremble, almost coming undone.\n'Been a while… since I got hit by a sonic attack… I think…'\nHis shadow continued to glide across the glistening bridge at great speed.\n\nAnd just before he reached the snowy mountain, winged figures burst from it in a veil of ash, spreading like an obsidian swarm.\nThey were the shades of the Crystal Wasps he and Slayer had slain - almost a hundred of them.\nTwo more arrows pierced the Snow Worm's flesh, making it convulse and shrink a little.\n\nSunny rose out of the shadows, and the shadows rose with him, turning into a towering figure encased in a carapace of gorgeous black jade. Standing a hundred meters tall, the Shadow Colossus pulled a hundred - meter - long odachi out of the darkness and glanced up, at the huge head of the Cursed Beast looming high above him.\nThe Snow Worm actually dwarfed Sunny and his titanic Shell. The creature's circular maw could swallow him whole.\nAs the swarm of Obsidian Wasps surrounded the peak of the mountain, Sunny raised his gigantic odachi and pointed it at the Cursed Beast.\n'I am going to kill you today, vermin.'\nThe Snow Worm seemed to stare at him for a moment, even if it had no eyes.\nAnd then, its maw plummeted down, obscuring the heavens.\nThe mountain shuddered."

    "title": "2346 Intricate Control.docx",
    "content": "2346 Intricate Control\n'Holy… hell…'\nThe second the Snow Worm struck, the entire mountain groaned, and the world itself seemed to shudder in agony. Sunny had witnessed truly harrowing power before, but he had never been so close to something so annihilating, so destructive. Even if he had not been stripped of his shadows and weakened by the Snow Domain, he would have been utterly obliterated by this one strike…\nBut of course, only if he was foolish enough to get struck.\n\nNot even trying to evade the gargantuan maw of the Cursed Beast, Sunny simply pulled his entire titanic Shell into the shadows, stepping through them to bring down his odachi on the pale flesh of the Snow Worm on the other side of the mountain.\nThe hundred-meter-long blade cut deep, but even its great length was not enough to sever the Nightmare Creature in two.\nIn the next moment, the body of the Snow Worm moved, slamming into Sunny with frightening force and throwing him back.\n'Crap.'\nThe deep wound he had deаlt the Cursed Beast was already gone, replaced by more pale flesh. The snow under Sunny's feet, meanwhile, rippled peculiarly…\n\nHe leaped back, and a split second later, the snow collapsed, falling into the huge maw that appeared beneath.\nThe Snow Worm's head shot from below, and then, it was as if a pale wall rose in front of Sunny, reaching toward the sky.\nThat was the neck of the huge Nightmare Creature, who had pierced a tunnel through the mountain and tried to swallow Sunny by appearing right beneath him.\nNot wasting any time, Sunny rushed forward and plunged his odachi into the pale flesh, using the creature's own momentum to deliver it a long, gruesome cut.\nAlmost at the same time, two more arrows pierced the flesh of the Cursed Beast.\nAnd then, two more.\nIts huge body seemed to shrink a little… or did it only seem that way?\n'Argh!'\nTwo walls of pale flesh were rushing at Sunny from higher up the slope and lower down the slope - they were the coils of the Snow Worm, who was twisting its body to crush the adversary.\n'Not… so quick…'\n\nSunny barely managed to step through the shadows in time. His Shell was made from them, but it was too heavy, too large - it took him far longer to dive into the shadows than when he was in human form, which could do the same almost instantaneously.\nStill, he escaped with his life.\nAs the head of the Snow Worm turned in the frigid air and rushed down once more, the Obsidian Wasps dove from the sky to attack the huge Nightmare Creature.\nScores of Supreme shades were a lethal threat to almost any creature, but they were too vulnerable in front of a Cursed Beast. After all, shades did not possess the Will, and worse than that, they were weakened by the Snow Domain. So they could be easily crushed and sent back into Sunny's soul if he used them recklessly.\nLuckily, there was one silver lining to how heavily suppressed he was here, in Ariel's Game.\n\nSunny had gone about becoming Supreme in a somewhat backward fashion. By the time he learned how to manifest his Domain, it was already vast and powerful, built out of tens of thousands of shades. Faced with their overwhelming number, he had always struggled to control his Shadow Legion - control it with any level of precision, at least.\nBut here, Sunny was devoid of his vast army. Instead, he could only command a relatively small number of shades thаt had been earned inside the Game.\nThat allowed him to command each one intricately.\nHe had been training himself to control the Obsidian Wasps precisely for the past few days, ever since earning the first one. Handling a hundred shades was far easier than thousands, especially since his mind was free of having to control his other incarnations and keep an eye on the members of the Shadow Clan.\nHis mind had plenty of unused capacity for the first time in years, so his efforts to learn how to control his shades better fell into fertile soil.\n\nAt first, Sunny simply concentrated on having the Obsidian Wasps move in different directions. Then, he made each of them follow an elaborate path. After mastering easy maneuvers, he moved on to practicing more intricate and complicated tasks, eventually arriving at simulated battles between different groups of shades.\nBy now, the Obsidian Wasps did not exactly feel like extensions of his own body… but he felt confident in making each of them do precisely what he wanted.\n\nThat expanded his strategic repertoire greatly, of course.\nRight now, he had to give his shades an opportunity to attack the Snow Worm without being destroyed by it.\nSo… he aimed them precisely at the areas on its enormous body where its tough hide had been cut by his towering odachi.\nThe Obsidian Wasps plummeted from the sky, their glasslike wings burning with a crimson glow in the light of the setting sun, and crawled into the Snow Worm's open wounds.\nHidden within its voluminous body, where they could not be crushed and devoured by the Cursed Beast, they bit into its flesh, burying themselves deeper and deeper into it as their legs and mandibles cut and shredded the Nightmare Creature's muscles.\nThe Snow Worm was huge, but its size could be used as a weapon against it. For now, no more than a dozen shades had managed to crawl into its wounds… but there were going to be more wounds, and more Obsidian Wasps finding their way into the creature's body.\nThe arrows shot by Kai and Slayer, meanwhile, were constricting the Snow Worm's ability to expand itself more and more.\n'It's working.'\n\nAs the Cursed Beast's head fell from the sky on Sunny, its shadow covered him. Turning his odachi downward, he plunged it into the Nightmare Creature's shadow, then collapsed into it to flee the horrifying maw at the last possible second.\nHis strike dealt some damage to the creature's vast, corrupted soul - not enough to threaten its life, but enough to be felt.\nThe Snow Worm's flesh rippled in agony. 'I think I can kill it.'\nThe only question was…\nWould Sunny be able to kill the damned monstrosity in time?\nThe sun was setting, and the clock was ticking. If he was not quick enough…\nThe one being killеd would be him."

    "title": "2347 Curse of Abundance.docx",
    "content": "2347 Curse of Abundancе\nSunny played hide and search with the Snow Worm by jumping between shadows while the mountain was falling apart around them. The creature's huge size made it difficult for him to destroy its body, but it also made it difficult for the creature to destroy him.\nThe pale, segmented coils of the Snow Worm were wrapped around the entire mountain countless times over, expanding and constricting as they moved at great speed and slowly ground the mountain to dust. Because of their sheer mass and number, the Cursed Beast was its own obstacle when hunting down an foe as mobile as Sunny.\n\nThe Snow Worm twisted its coils unpredictably to catch and crush Sunny between them. When two walls of pale flesh collided, violent shockwaves sent ripples across the sea of clouds, and the entire world seemed to shake. At the same time, its maw was pursuing Sunny, easily digging tunnels through the mountain or soaring into the sky to plummet down seconds later like a ghastly meteor.\nThese impacts were even more earth-shattering.\nSunny was being attacked from all sides, from below, from above… and yet, despite the unfathomable might of the Cursed Beast, he remained mostly unscathed. He was simply too quick and elusive to be caught, moving fгom one spot to another almost instantly to evade the frightening blows.\n\nThat was why pure might was useless unless it was supported by a keen mind, skill, or at least agility. The Snow Worm was undoubtedly a creature of distressing power, but without proper means to channel that power, all it could achieve was thrash wildly and slowly take the mountain apart in its furious, fruitless pursuit of the nimble adversary.\nThen again, as the battle continued, Sunny got the impression that pure, focused lethality was not exactly the Snow Worm's strong suit. Rather, it seemed like a creature who subjugated its prey through its sheer… abundance.\nThe Snow Worm was too enormous, too voluminous, too inexhaustible. Its infinite body allowed it to weather an infinite number of attacks, only for more pale flesh to burst forward, burying the adversary under its endless mass. So, it could simply endure endlessly, until the adversary was exhausted, tired, and spent.\nIn this case, the Snow Worm simply needed to endure until nightfall.\n\nIt was a single-minded and patient creature. And yet, it was exactly its single-mindedness that made the Snow Worm so frightening… its extreme mastery of a single power, of a single concept - used both for attack and defense - made it almost inevitable.\n…As the Sovereign of Death, Sunny took offense to that.\nAfter all, nothing was supposed to be more inevitable than death.\n'If only my legion was here…'\nGrowling, he fled from the Snow Worm while shredding its flesh with his great blade. Sunny did not discriminate between attacking the body of the Cursed Beast and its shadow, dealing both physical аnd soul damage to it.\nThe soul of the Snow Worm was as vast and seemingly endless as its flesh, hiding an infinite amount of vile darkness. When souls received a certain amount of damage, they collapsed and crumbled - except for Sunny's own tenacious soul, which was reinforced by Soul Weave and therefore had no such threshold.\nAnd yet, he felt that the soul of the Snow Worm was too enormous, too ancient, and too deep to be destroyed that way - at least while he was devoid of his shadows and weakened by the Snow Domain.\nPerhaps that was what the souls of all deities were like, or perhaps the soul of this corrupted deity in particular was especially abundant. In any case, destroying it was not something that could be accomрlished easily.\nFortunately, Sunny was nothing if not resourceful. Even if dealing a sufficient amount of soul damage was not feasible, he had other means of destroying a soul.\nAfter all, he wielded the power of shadows… the power of death. Just as Nеphis had mentioned, each Will was unique, and his was all about killing intent. It was the will to see living beings die. That was both his natural affinity and a skill he had developed by wielding Serpent, the Slaying Blade.\nIn other words, his Will was more effective and efficient than it was supposed to be when implemented for the purpose of killing. And while the Snow Worm was a being of a higher Rank than Sunny, its Will was not as sophisticated as his.\nSunny understood it as he was desperately fighting the detestable creature. Yes, the Snow Worm was more powerful than him, and its Will was far more harrowing. However, just like a mindless beast could not fathom a combat technique, the colossal Nightmare Creature could not wield its Will with focused intent either.\nThe Will of the Snow Worm was not much different from the elemental and largely directionless Will of the millipede swarm. And so, Sunny actually had a clear advantage over the profane deity.\nTherefore, he could infuse each of his soul attacks with the power of Death - with the focused will to see the adversary die - and that will slowly accumulated, poisoning the soul of the Snow Worm. The quantity of damage he dealt to the adversary's soul might not have been sufficient, but its insidious quality was a completely separate issue.\nEven if each cut dealt to the shadow of the Cursed Beast was insignificant due to how vast it was, all of that vastness was poisoned by the Death Will regardless of its nearly endless nature. As soon as Sunny expressed enough will to kill the Snow Worm to overcome its will to live, the creature was going to die.\nWhich was not to say that he would be able to achieve that before the sun disappeared beyond the horizon.\nHowever, that was only half of Sunny's strategy.\nThe other half was far simpler - he simply wanted to rip, shred, and devastate the Snow Worm's huge body.\nThat, too, was a way to kill the enormous Cursed Beast."

    "title": "2348 Death Will.docx",
    "content": "2348 Death Will\nEvery cut Sunny dealt to the Snow Worm's voluminous body served a purpose, and that purpose was to allow more Obsidian Wasps to crawl inside it.\n\nBy now, almost all of them had found their way into the Cursed Beast. They were slithering there, wreaking havoc and mangling tissue while burrowing deeper and deeper. Even if the wounds Sunny dealt to the huge Nightmare Creature were relatively insignificant, being mangled and devoured by a hundred Supreme shades from the inside was not.\nAnd yet, the Snow Worm endured the harrowing amount of damage being dealt to it almost effortlessly, demonstrating the vast divide between the Supreme and the Sacred - or rather, Cursed - Ranks.\n\nMore than that, even buried deep within its flesh, the Obsidian Wasps were not entirely safe. In fact, numerous of them had already been destroyed. Some were simply crushed by the unfathomably powerful muscles of the Cursed Beast. Some had accidentally found their way into its digestive system and were either ground to dust or dissolved entirely. Some met their end in ways that Sunny could not even describe, let alone understand, while some were destroyed in more bizarre ways.\nSince the Snow Worm wielded the concept of infinity as its weapon and could expand or shrink its body at will, some Obsidian Wasps were simply torn asunder when the point in space they had occupied suddenly expanded. Others were crushed into infinitely small balls of obsidian when the space they had been occupying shrank.\n\nOf course, none of them were actually destroyed - rather, they were returned to the dark expanse of Sunny's soul. But they were eliminated from this fateful battle, which was ostensibly the same.\n'Gods… just how indestructible is that thing?'\n\nThe mountain was full of holes by now, groaning precariously, which made it difficult for Sunny to find sure footing as he kept escaping the Cursed Beast's awful attacks. The Snow Worm showed no outward signs of being seriously harmed by the swarm of Obisidian Wasps, for now… Which was not to say that it was unharmed.\nIn fact, Sunny could sense the cadence of the battle slowly changing.\n\nHe felt a bit of vicious joy as he realized that his preparations had not been for naught, and that his strategy was working. Just as he had planned, he was going to defeat this overwhelmingly powerful adversary by using his advantages - his intelligence, cunning, and skill.\n\nBy then, Kai and Slayer had sunk all of the Finality Arrows he had crafted into the Worm's flesh. The enchantments Sunny had so laboriously created were locking various segments of its body in space, making it more difficult for the creature to exercise its infinite power.\nAt the same time, the Obsidian Wasps were ravaging the Snow Worm's insides, while Sunny was poisoning its soul with the power of his deathly will. Kai and Slayer, meanwhile, switched to purely annihilating arrows, helping him wound the Cursed Beast as much as they could.\nTheir Transcendent wills were added to his Supreme killing intent, tipping the scales. As Sunny poisoned the soul of the Snow Worm more and more, suffocating the very spark that kept it alive, the creature weakened. The weaker it became, the less it could resist the binding power of enchantments constricting its power. And the more constricted its power was, the more physical harm the Obsidian Wasps could deal it.\n\nWhich, in turn, made its life force weaken more.\nIt was a virtuous cycle… a wicked cycle?\nIt was a cycle that would bring this huge, mindless, corrupted deity to death.\n'Come on, you scum… die faster!'\n\nSunny's Shell, too, was slowly coming undone. Even if he managed to avoid being struck by the Snow Worm directly, the damage dealt to the Shadow Colossus through simply being in the epicenter of unimaginable destruction was mounting. Still, he persisted.\n\nBecause he could sense it - slowly but surelу, the enormous body of the Snow Worm was shrinking. Instead of infinitely growing, it was gradually reducing in size. He could not see the result due to the sheer scale of the Snow Worm, but he could sense it through the shadows. Already, there were fewer coils surrounding the mountain…\nAnd as the battle continued, the rate at which the Snow Worm was shrinking only accelerated. By the time Kai had run out of arrows, Sunny could already see its tail. The maw of the creature, too, had diminished in size - it could still swallow Sunny in one bite, but at least not without doing some chewing first.\n\nAs he stepped through the shadows and rolled on the heavily damaged, perforated slope of the mountain, a new shadow suddenly joined the fray.\n'What… is this maniac doing?'\nA haunting sound that resembled a song suddenly permeated the sky, and a sonic wave struck the head of the Cursed Beast, shredding some of its flesh and changing its direction slightly.\n\nA gorgeous dragon plummeted from above, landing on the Cursed Beast's back and striking at it with its long, sharp claws. At the same time, Kai seemed to have spoken something - the Snow Worm largely ignored his command… but not entirely.\nSunny almost missed a graceful figure that shot an arrow into an open wound of the Cursed Beast from the dragon's back. Slayer wanted to kill the weakened deity, as well.\n\nThe sun had already fallen halfway behind the horizon.\n'We need to hurry.'\nAfter that, the demise of the Snow Worm was hastened.\nThe damage dealt to its soul and body had accumulated, and its ability to command infinity grew unstable. It shrank its body more and more, crushing the Obsidian Wasps within… but it was already too late.\nSoon enough, the Cursed Beast could barely wrap itself around the mountain. Then, its maw became too narrow to swallow the Shadow Colossus - that, ironically enough, made it more dangerous, since it could maneuver much better for a short while. So, Sunny abandoned his Shell and continued the battle as a human.\nBefore too long, the Snow Worm shrank to a truly pitiful size - no more than a kilometer from head to tail.\nThen, it became even smaller, similar in size to Soul Serpent.\n\n…And then, finally, Sunny exhaled tiredly as he leaned on his odachi, looking down at a pale maggot that was wriggling in the mud.\nThat tiny maggot was the formerly proud Cursed Beast.\nSunny glanced at it darkly, his eyes hidden in the deep shadows of the falling dusk.\n\nHow could something so great become so pathetic?\n'Was that… how the gods died?'\nHis tone was strangely forlorn.\n'Maybe I'll learn before ending this game.'\nWith that, Sunny brought his foot down, crushing the tiny maggot under his armored boot.\nThere was a second of silence, and then, he heard the familiar words…\n[You have slain an adversary.]\nSunny sighed with relief as the last vestige of the sun disappeared from view.\nHe had killed his first Cursed One today."

    "content": "2349 One Less Pawn\n'So… a deity only accounts for this much, in the end.'\nLooking down, Sunny did not feel too triumphant. Rather, he was troubled.\nKilling a Cursed Beast sounded like a startling accomplishment… and it was, in a sense. However, as a Supreme Titan, that was what he was supposed to be capable of. The true challenge would come when he had to face Cursed Demons, Devils, and Tyrants - the dreadful deities who were just as intelligent and cunning as he was, if not more.\n\nAnd then there were beings as distressing as Cursed Terrors and Titans. Like the Vile Thieving Bird, who had stolen his very fate from him.\nSunny did not expect easy victories once he graduated to battling those creatures.\n\nJust as he thought about it, a chill ran down his spine. Feeling a cold gaze settle on him, Sunny turned back and glanced in the direction of the Axis Tree. He could not see the Devil resting on one of its branches, but knew that he was being watched.\n'I guess we had an audience.'\nMuch worse was the realization of just how vast the divide between Great and Cursed beings was. Every Rank was progressively more powerful, and the gaps between them grew exponentially.\n\nAnd if the Cursed One were already this overwhelming, then just how terrible the Unholy Ones would be?\nSmiling darkly, Sunny took a step back and crouched, digging in the squashed remains of the Snow Worm with a disgusted grimace on his face.\n\nJust then, Kai landed near him in a gust of wind, having already reverted to his human form. Slayer was not far behind, either, walking over from higher up the ruined slope.\nThe latter was concerned and calm, like she always was, but the former seemed stunned.\n'We… did we just kill a Cursed Beast?'\nSunny hummed nonchalantly.\n'Indeed we did.'\n\nWith that, he stood up and raised a hand, glancing at a tiny gem held between his fingers. It shone gorgeously in the twilight of dusk, its radiant depths peculiarly mesmerizing.\nHis expression, however, was peculiar.\n'Would you look at that, Kai? This is the first Sacred soul shard I have ever gotten my hands on. But… why is it so tiny?'\nNo, really. Sunny felt cheated!\nKai coughed.\n'That… I don't think that the size of a soul shard matters, Sunny.'\nSunny pursed his lips, then sighed and hid the radiant gem in his armor.\n'I guess. That said, buddy, I think you should turn back into a dragon.'\nKai blinked a couple of times, then activated his Transcendent Ability once more. Sunny hurried Slayer, and once both of them jumped onto the dragon's back, shouted for Kai to fly up.\n\nA few moments after Kai rose into the air, the eruption began. This one was far more violent than the previous ones due to how severely damaged by the Snow Worm the mountain had been. It practically fell apart and then rose again, its slopes formed by the cooled lava.\nA new volcano stood in place of the collapsed mountain in no time, just as tall and seemingly indestructible as the mountain had been.\nOnce the three of them landed, Sunny went about erecting a new shadow manor. He shook his head while building it, somewhat shocked.\n'That Ariel was really something, wasn't he? Who just goes around making mountains out of thin air? Unbelievable, truly mind-boggling. That's a real daemon for you!'\nKai was observing him with a nonplussed expression. Hearing that, the charming archer shifted his gaze to the opulent manor that was rising from the darkness, as if summoned by magic.\n'Yeah… unbelievable…'\nThis time, Sunny went for a modern style with panoramic windows that opened to the gorgeous sight of the starlit sea of clouds. Making manifested shadows transparent was much easier than imbuing them with color, so he went a bit crazy with the glassworks.\nOf course, an actual architect or a designer would shed tears at his clumsy attempts to build something, but it was more than enough for a temporary shelter that would be destroyed in a day or two.\n\nOnce inside, Sunny rested on a sofa and sighed. He did not quite get its properties right, so the sofa felt both too hard and too soft at the same time. It was these little details that were the hardest to master - shaping the facade of a building was relatively easy, unless he wanted to adorn it with decorative elements, but making the interior feel real was very difficult.\nHe was exhausted, both physically and mentally. Kai seemed utterly spent, too. After dismissing the outer layers of his armor, the charming archer lowered himself into an armchair and closed his eyes.\nSunny took out the Sacred soul shard and studied it some more, enjoying the gorgeous glow.\n'Do you know why death was created, Kai?'\nKai glanced at him in confusion.\n'Death… created?'\nSunny smiled.\n'Of course. There was a time when death did not exist… well, actually, time did not exist back thеn either. Everything we know as the axiomatic laws of existence was actually created at some point by the gods to contain the Void. The Void was endless and everlasting, after all, so they needed to create some form of finality to cаge it. It just struck me as funny that our battle against the Snow Worm was a bit similar to that. A struggle between infinity and finality.'\nHe remained silent for a while, then added:\n'Anyway, it was Shadow God who created Death, and nobody - not even the gods - liked him very much because of that. Death was initially a weapon against the Void and the eternal beings that dwelled in it. Even now, death dutifully destroys the Corruption, which is caused by the malignant influence of the Void. That is why we can kill a Cursed Nightmare Creature and retrieve a Sacred soul shard from its corpse.'\nKai blinked a couple of times.\n'Oh. I… I never thought about that, actually. Now that I do, it does seem peculiar.'\nSunny threw the soul shard into the air and caught it.\n'But really, if you think about it, death doesn't really exist. Or rather, death is not what people think it is.'\nKai raised an eyebrow, confused.\nSunny chuckled.'People think of death like it is the end, but actually, it is merely a transformation. Shadow God swallowed everything that died and… digested it, I guess, within himself. Ground it all into pure essence, then released it back into the world. He is gone now, but the laws he established still persist. So no one ever really disappears. They just… become something new.'\nKai smiled faintly.\n'That is a soothing thought, I guess.'\nSunny let out a quiet laugh.\n'Yes, but I've been thinking… what does that make me? After all, I am somewhat of a thief. The things I kill never reach the Shadow Realm. Instead, they simply remain in my soul forever.'\nHe scratched the back of his head.\n'Maybe I can learn how to digest them, too. But if there is a way to do that, I have not learned it yet.'\nKai let out a long sigh, leaned back in his chair, and closed his eyes again.\n'So, you want to learn how to digest dead beings after swallowing thеm. I see. Any particular reason why?'\nSunny fell into deep thought and remained silent for a while.\nThen, his eyes gleamed.\n'Come to think of it, it is all because of that dastardly worm. I mean, that thing was huge, right? So I was really hoping to eat some worm meat today. But it just had to go and turn tiny in the end! No meat for us, damn it…'\nHearing another deep sigh, he frowned and glanced at Kai with reproach.\n'What? Aren't you hungry? No way. Even if you're not hungry, I am!'\nThere was no answer."

    "content": "2350 Igneous Rock\nIn the morning, Sunny observed the movements of the Snow figures tensely. The Clockwork Giant was still in pursuit, occupying the volcano they had just left. The Snow Devil, meanwhile, remained where it had been, choosing not to abandon the Axis Tree.\nSunny let out a relieved sigh.\n\nAt this point, his position on the board was still precarious. He needed three moves to reach the Shrine of Truth - and so did the Snow Devil. Considering that it had the initiative, though, the guardian of the Axis Tree would have arrived there first if it wanted to. Now that it had skipped a move, though, Sunny had the initiative and would reach the Shrine sooner.\n\nIt was a bit unnerving, really, because he could not help but question the behavior of the adversary. Why had the Snow Devil remained passive? Was it because staying on the Axis Tree gave the Snow Domain some kind of advantage, or was it simply because the Snow Tyrant wanted to surround the Shrine with more figures before mounting a three - pronged attack to crush Sunny in one fell swoop?\n\n'We'll see when we get there.' There was something else for him to consider, as well. There were eight more Snow figures on the board that Sunny could not see. None of them had appeared, yet, and he suspected that they had been staying in their initial positions until now.\nBut Sunny had a sinking suspicion that all of them had departed from their squares this morning, moving in the direction of the Shrine of Truth.\n\nThere was a very simple reason why he believed that. Befоre, the Snow Tyrant had no way to guess where Sunny was going - after all, he had gone directly north after abandoning the Ash Castle, never changing direction. But then, Sunny turned west and killed the Snow Worm. That indicated his desire to conquer the Shrine of Truth, and gave the adversary an understanding of his plans - and, therefore, the ability to build an appropriate strategy.\n\n'How troublesome.'\nIt would take the group of Snow figures in the north from four to six moves to reach the Shrine of Truth. The group occupying the Shrine of Fear, meanwhile, would need from six to seven moves to get there.\n\nThere was the Snow Demon from the left corner to worry about, too, who could already be in the Shrine of Truth or en route to it. But Sunny was not too worried about a solitary figure.\nIn any case, the coast was clear - for now, at least.\n\n'We should enjoy these days of peace.' Once they reached the Shrine, it would most likely be one harrowing battle after another. So, it was good that Sunny had a few days to prepare.\nMost of the Obsidian Wasps had been destroyed in the battle against the Snow Worm. It was going to take some time for them to repair themselves… additionally, he could dedicate this time to weaving.\nHe could create more arrows for Kai and improve his bow. More importantly, there was the Sacred soul shard in his possession now. Using it, he could create something truly special.\n\nBut currently, Sunny was worried about something else. Looking away from the Axis Tree, he stared at Kai and nudged him on the shoulder.\n'Well? Did you find it?'\nKai coughed awkwardly.\n'Well… it's a big mountain, Sunny. Give me more time.'\nSunny blinked a couple of times.\n'What do you mean, it's a big mountain? You can see through аsh! You can see through rock! How hard can it be to find a piece of flawless white jade in this pile of obsidian and solidified magma?'\nKai let out an exasperated sigh.\n'It would be less difficult if I could concentrate for a few seconds, Sunny…'\nSunny scoffed.\n'Oh! I see you know how to talk back now. Hey. Look at Slayer - she has never talked back to me once.'\nSlayer gave him a look, her black eyes full of such dreadful malice that he almost flinched.\n',I mean, she does drink my blood and tries to kill me every week. But at least she does it silently!'\n\nThe thing Sunny wanted Kai to find was, naturally, the figure of the Snow Beast he was supposed to receive for killing the colossal worm. He had been so engrossed in appreciating the aesthetic beauty of the Sacred soul shard - and not at all overcome by greed! - that he had forgotten about it entirely at the moment.\nAnd then, the entire mountain fell apart.\n\nConsidering that they had to move on fгom this newborn volcano by evening, Sunny felt quite pressed to find the jade figurine. After all, it was invaluable.\nHe was already starting to grow nervous when Kai finally smiled.\n'There, I see it.'\nHe pointed in the vaguе direction where the Snow Worm had died.\n'It's right there, about five hundred metres underground, stuck in igneous rock.'\nSunny let out a relieved sigh.\n'Good, good.'\nThen, he fell silent.\n\nAfter a few moments of that, Kai finally asked:\n'So… are you going to dig it out? No, wait. You probably have better things to do?'\nHe looked at Slayer, then glanced away and added wistfully:\n'I guess… I should dig it out?'\nSunny remained silent for a while, then shook his head.\n'No. At least not yet. I have another candidate in mind.'\nWith that, he took a deep breath and turned into a shadow.\nNothing happened for a long while.\nThen, suddenly, a flood of ash escaped from the shadow, rising into the sky like a towering pillar. Then the pillar of ash bent and plummeted down, twisting as it assumed form.\nSoon enough, the maw of an enormous black worm hit the slope of the mountain, easily burrowing into the seemingly impregnable rock.\n\nThe shadow turned into a human once again. Sunny gave Kai a faltering smile, trying to hide how strained every fiber of his being was.\n'That… uh… that should be quicker, no?'"

    "title": "2351 Sacred Shade.docx",
    "content": "2351 Sacred Shade\nSunny had never been able to summon the shade of Condemnation, and that was not for the lack of trying.\nThe shadow of the fallen god simply refused to submit to his will. It was too vast, too ancient, and too unfathomable to be compelled by his commands, while Sunny himself was not nearly powerful enough to assert his authority over it.\nIn a sense, trying to deal with the shadow of Condemnation was even more difficult than trying to command the Fragment of the Shadow Realm.\nAfter becoming a Supreme, Sunny could manipulate the Fragment a little bit - enough so to separate it from the Nameless Temple, at least, even if it had felt like moving a mountain. The Fragment was devoid of personality, though, while the shadow of Condemnation… it had a mind of its own.\nOr a shadow of a mind of its own, at least.\n\nIn any case, Sunny could not summon the shadow of Condemnation. The dead god remained in the tranquil darkness of his soul, seemingly at peace, and since it was the only shade of the Sacred Rank there, Sunny simply assumed that he cоuld not command shades of a higher Rank thаn his own.\nAfter facing the Snow Worm in battle, though, he began to doubt that theory. The Cursed Beast had been frightening and dreadfully powerful, true, but not… beyond the realm of understanding, when compared to Sunny. More than that, Sunny had already experienced if not overpowering, then at least defeating the creature's Will.\nPlus, unlike Condemnation, he had killed the Snow Worm with his own two hands… metaphorically speaking.\nIn truth, naturally, he had killed it with his boot.\nSo who was to say that he could not command its shade? How could the shadow of a mere Beast rebel against the Lord of Shadows?\nSo, that was exactly what Sunny tried to do. He tried to summon the shade of the Snow Worm and make it follow his commands.\nThe result… was both promising and disappointing.\nJust like Condemnation, the Snow Worm… Abundance… refused to answer Sunny's call. Really, it was not even so much a refusal as it was a flat - out indifference. Both Sacred shades simply ignored Sunny and his commands.\nHowever, unlike Condemnation, Abundance was not so immense as to be indomitable. So, Sunny let his temper flare and descended upon the easy - minded shadow with all the ferocious power of his cold and imposing Will.\n'Come here, you!'\n…That, too, felt like moving a mountain.\nThe thing, though, was that Sunny actually possessed enough willpower to move this particular mountain.\nAnd so, the mountain responded his call and came to him.\n'Ah…'\nSunny felt a crushing pressure fall upon him the second the shadow of Abundance reluctantly passed through the gate of his soul and escaped into the miniature world of Ariel's Game.\n'That… uh… that should be quicker, no?'\nHe pretended to smile while wincing on the inside.\nControlling a Sacred shade was different from controlling the other members of his Shadow Legion. Summoning his army of shades, even those of the Supreme Rank, felt effortless and natural. Summoning the shade of Abundance, though, required him to keep overcoming its reluctance both continuously and meticulously. Needless to say, that put quite a strain on Sunny.\nIn short, it was like riding an enraged bull.\n…Sunny assumed that bulls were some kind of horse - like creatures who somehow managed to be even more ill - tempered than horses. Considering that the only horse he knew was Nightmare, that painted a pretty horrifying picture.\nHe did not know why anyone sane would choose to ride such a creature, but the experience must have been similar to his attempts at keeping Abundance under control.\nThere was another unexpected complication to summoning a Sacred shade, as well. Usually, Sunny did not need to worry about essence while commanding his Shadow Legion - the flow of it he received from his shades was far greater than the expenditure needed to keep them summoned. The situation was reversed for the shadow of Abundance, though. Not only was the Ash Domain weak and feeble when compared to Sunny's actual Domain, but keeping the damn worm summoned was consuming his essence at a disheartening rate. He would not be able to maintain the summoning indefinitely… he would not be able to maintain it for too long, even, which meant that calling upon Sacred shades was a tool that had to be used strategically.\n\nIt was still amazing news for Sunny, though. Not because Abundance would be able to excavate the volcano and retrieve its own figure faster than Kai would, naturally.\nRather, it was because Sunny had been worried about the Rank of his enemies for a while, now. It was a stroke of great luck that the first Snow figure they had faced was a swarm of Great Beasts - slaying them had not only weakened the Snow Domain, but also strengthened Sunny.\nIf the rest of the nightmare creatures on the board had been Cursed, however, then he would not have been able to grow his army exponentially. And that was what Sunny had been counting on… that was his only hope of winning the Death Game despite starting it in a tremendously disadvantaged position.\nIn a position so hopeless and dire that it had made Ariel, the Demon of Dread, admit defeat.\n'Look carefully, Snow Tyrant, whoever you are.'\nSunny's smile grew firmer as he watched Abundance burrow into solid rock.\nHe was going to slay the abominations of the Snow Domain, one after another, and turn them into his own soldiers.\nAnd with those soldiers, he was going to lay siege the Snow Castle, and bring its rulеr down.\nBest of all, he was going to bring his army of Sacred shades out of Ariel's Game into the real world.\nSo, the piece of Weaver's Lineage was not the only boon he would carry away from this peculiar, lethal miniature world.\n'How nice. There are ten of them left, aren't there?'\nKai glanced at him dubiously.\n'What are you thinking about? You look… suspiciously cheerful?'\nSunny laughed happily, I was just thinking about how there are ten more eldritch horrors waiting to kill us in horrendous ways. Isn't it wonderful?\nKai exhaled slowly.\n'Wonderful? Oh, wonderful. Wonderful, he says. And he means it, too! That… is not the word I would have used…'"

    "content": "2352 Shrine of Truth\n\nIn the evening, they abandoned the newly formed volcano and moved west. And in the morning, the volcano was no more, conquered by the Clockwork Giant and transformed into a snow - covered mountain.\n\nSunny quietly mourned the destruction of yet another manor he had built. 'What even is the point? Ah, I already miss my weirdly stiff, but overly soft sofa…'\n\nHe did not miss any Memory more than he missed the Shadow Chair.\n\nNow that they had moved one more square west, the Axis Tree finally disappeared from view. That was a relief for Sunny, who did not need to feel the gaze of the Snow Devil anymore… but at the same time, it made him tense, because they had no way of knowing what the Devil was doing now.\n\nThat paled in comparison to the fact that they finally saw the Shrine of Truth, though. Well, Kai saw it… possibly Slayer, too. Sunny was simply comforted by the thought that it was there.\n\nHe could see eight surrounding peaks from the current square. The Shrine was two moves away, diagonally northwest of their position.\nDiagonally southwest, meanwhile, similarly two moves away from the Shrine…\n\n'Are you certain?'\nKai nodded grimly.\n'Yes. That should be the Snow Demon.'\n\nSunny frowned. The Snow Demon seemed to have abandoned the corner of the board, moving one square up. That made little sense, considering that it could have reached the Shrine of Truth already…\n\nUnless the Snow Tyrant wanted to use the Shrine as a lure to trap Sunny and his Ash Beasts, with nowhere to retreat. If that was its plan, then the Snow Demon would politely let them pass instead of intercepting them come morning.\nSunny sighed.\n'So, what does it look like?'\nKai hesitated for а while.\n'Well, I'm not sure.'\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n'How come? Don't you have the all - seeing eye?'\nKai smiled faintly.\n'No… I merely have the most - seeing eye.'\nHe chuckled quietly and added in a neutral tone:\n'Remember how you mentioned creepy wraiths made of snow?'\nSunny did vaguely remember suggesting something like that whеn they had first encountered the Snow Devil.\n'Don't tell me.'\nΚai nodded.\n'Indeed. The Snow Demon is a creepy wraith made of snow. There is a blizzard raging on the mountains, and something is hiding in that blizzard. But I'm not sure what it is. Honestly, I only noticed its presence because the currents of snow seem unnatural, as if avoiding something… or someone.'\n\nSunny sighed. 'My damned tongue. Why couldn't I have suggested pretty wraiths made of snow instead of creepy ones? Or better yet, creepy wraiths made of delicious food. That'd be great, too.'\nKai scratched his head.\n'Can wraiths be made of food? I thought wraiths were supposed to be intangible.'\nSunny grimaced.\n'You make a fair point.'\nHe lingered for a moment, and then added in a disgruntled tone:\n'Have I ever mentioned that I hate wraiths? I once spent a few thousand years with a wraith stuck in my head. It had its uses, sure, but by the dead gods! Having a head wraith is so obnoxious. I do not recommend.'\nKai stared at him silently for a while.\n\nEventually, he asked in an even tone:\n'Who do you hate more, wraiths or birds?'\nSunny blinked a couple of times.\n'What an interesting question.'\nHe contemplated the answer, then shook his head decisively.\n'Birds are still worse. Definitely.'\n\nWith that, he wandered off to find a place to rest.\n\nSunny had been joking, but hunger was letting itself be known. It was merely a psychological dependency, of course, since he could sustain himself on nothing but his essence… Kai was far from being weakened by the lack of food, as well. Saints could go without sustenance for a long while. But everything was relative, of course.\nIf it been Effie whom Sunny took with him on this journey, for example, she would have been dead or dying from hunger by now, becаuse of her Flaw. The realization that he could have led one of his friends to their death, and had only been spared that guilt by dumb luck, made Sunny feel… enraged.\n\nHe had not felt that powerless in a long, long while. It was not a good feeling at all, but the truth was both obvious and ruthless. No matter how much Sunny had grown, and no matter how well he prepared, he was still nothing in front of beings like the Demon of Dread. The laws of a miniature realm Ariel had created to use as a toy were enough to render all Sunny's power meaningless.\n'I'll throw this damned board into the Sky Below after we get out of here.'\n\n…But of course, he wouldn't. Ariel's Game was too precious.\nOnce it was cleared of the frightening abominations left here by Ariel and Weaver, it could be populated by far more manageable monsters. Then, it could be used as a training tool for the Saints who aspired to become Sovereigns, or even for those Supremes who had risen to their Rank only recently.\nAfter all, while the Ash Domain was a downgrade for Sunny, the experience of ruling it could be precious to someone else.\nHe sighed and went about his business.\n\nIn the morning, the Snow Demon remained where it was, indicating that Sunny's suspicion was true - the Snow Tyrant was leaving the road to the Shrine of Truth wide open, intending to completely surround them there.\nSunny did not mind, though. In fact, that was exactly what he wanted to happen, as well.\n\nThey traveled one more square west in the evening, reaching the westernmost column of squares. At dawn, the Snow Demon once again remained in place, while the Clockwork Giant once again conquered the volcano they had just left.\n'That makes two.'\n\nOnce they reached the Shrine, both the Snow Demon and the Snow Beast would make one move north, surrounding Sunny and his companions from south and east. That would only leave an enemy to close the blockade from the north - and then, the three of them could attack the Shrine together.\nSunny did not know who the enemy would be, but he was going to find out soon.\n\nFinally, on their sixth sunset in Ariel's Game, they reached the Shrine of Truth.\n\nStepping on the slope of the lonesome mountain, Sunny knew that this was where the decisive battles of this Death Game were going to be fought.\nHe sighed heavily.\n'Game on, I guess.'"

    "title": "2353 Sacred Battlefield.docx",
    "content": "2353 Sacred Battlefield\nThe square of the Shrine was not different from the rest of them. It had been a snow - covered mountain before, but now that the Ash Domain swallowed it, the peak of the mountain shattered, and rivers of lava flowed down its slopes, melting away the snow and ice. Soon enough, it was covered in ash.\n\nSunny and his companions slowly ascended the slope of the newly born volcano, not in a hurry to reach the caldera. There was some time to spare, after all, since their enemies would need at least two moves to launch an attack.\n\n'It's interesting.' Sunny glanced at the pillar of smoke rising into the sky. He was reminded of his First Nightmare - the Namеless Temple had also been located atop a snowy peak, after all. But now, the peak of the mountain had exploded and crumbled, replaced by the crater of a fuming volcano. This meant that the Shrine of Truth could not have been located there.\n\n'Was it hidden in a cave?' He could ask Kai, but really, Sunny was not that curious. Kai, meanwhile, seemed a little troubled.\n\n'This time, there will be three Snow figures launching an attack at the same time, won't there?' Sunny shrugged. 'Most likely.'\n\nThe charming archer exhaled slowly. 'The two we killed were already terrible enough. Are you sure we will be able to handle three at the same time?'\n\nSunny hesitated for a little while. 'Well, we also have the Obsidian Hive and the shadow of Abundance with us now. And we don't need to kill all three - we just need to hold out until the sun rises. If we fortify this place well, it should be doable.' His expression darkened a little. 'The real problem is that we will have to repel them the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that… as countless times as it takes until one side is entirely obliterated.' He smiled faintly. 'But that was the very reason we decided to come here, wasn't it? To grow stronger every time a Snow figure is sacrificed to the Shrine of Truth.'\n\nIn fact, Sunny hoped that he would be able to make use of the Shrine even before the first siege. He carried two jade figurines, after all… the idea of wasting two truths pained him, but if the figures could be sacrificed to strengthen him and his allies, he was willing to part with them. Kai chuckled. 'You are still full of confidence, I see. Aren't you even a little bit afraid?'\n\nSunny shook his head. 'Why would I be? These things stopped scaring me a long, long time ago. It's like I've exhausted all the fear allotted to me at birth… ah, but I am not completely fearless. Do you know what really frightens me?'\n\nKai raised an eyebrow. 'What?'\n\nSunny took a deep breath and shivered. 'Watching Nephis pour honey on the pancakes I made. Now that's… that's frightening.'\n\nKai blinked a couple of times. 'What's wrong with honey?'\n\nSunny gave him an indignant glare. 'Everything! The better question would be what's right with honey… who in their right mind would taint innocent pancakes with something so vile?'\n\nThe charming archer just stared at him silently for a while, then took a shaky breath. 'And you're being sincere, too. But if you fear honey so much, why not tell Nephis to stop using it?'\n\nSunny coughed and glanced away. 'Well… why would I? If she likes honey, I am willing to fill the entire Ivory Tower with honey. If that is not enough, I'll replace the water in the lake with honey, too.'\n\nKai laughed. 'Aren't you sweet? Just like…' Sunny gave him a dark look. 'I suggest you stop there, pal. If you know what's good for you.' Kai only laughed louder.\n\nEventually, they crested the edge of the caldera and began the descent. Soon enough, they reached the main vent of the volcano and the pillar of smoke rising from it.\n\nThe Shrine of Truth rested on a platform suspended above the abyssal chasm on soot - covered chains. Unlike the Ash Castle, though, there was no fortress on the platform. Instead, there was a charred temple built from large blocks of stone, its edifice turned black by ash and smoke. Tall pillars, a broad frieze, a triangular pediment decorated by weathered reliefs… The Shrine of Truth looked vaguely familiar, like a shabby cousin of the Nameless Temple. The two were not exactly the same, but definitely resembled each other, as if built in the same style.\n\nSunny stared at the chаrred temple for a few seconds. 'Curious.'\n\nHe knew that the Nameless Temple was truly ancient. Since it had been originally dedicated to all seven gods of the pantheon, it must have been built at the very dawn of existence - after the Void was sealed, but before the seventh god was forgotten, his very memory forbidden. The daemons had been born roughly at the same time, so this kind of temple must have just become ingrained in Ariel's mind in the days of his youth. So, when he needed to create a rough model of a temple, he could have simply defaulted to this style without thinking too much.\n\nSunny tilted his head. Was it right to think about daemons in such easy terms? To imagine them so human?\n\nDaemons had been born Sacred, having been torn from the soul of a god. So, they could not have been too human… That said, they had been young once, too. They had experienced passions and sorrows, too. They had walked the Path of Ascension and elevated themselves to the Divine Rank.\n\nSo, who was to say that they had shared no similarity to mortal men like Sunny and Kai? Shaking his head, he turned to Slayer аnd grinned. 'Should I toss you over the chasm again?'\n\nShe gave him a cold, sinister look… then took a graceful step toward Kai, stopping near him silentlу. Sunny opened his eyes wide. 'Ah! The bitter pain of betrayal…'"

    "content": "2354 Plentiful Choices\nThe interior of the Shrine of Truth was much like the interior of the Ash Castle - a mere facsimile of an actual structure, as opposed to a real one. It was one vast chamber, more modest in size than the smoke-filled hall of the crumbling fortress, but still large enough for an enormous Abomination to occupy.\nOf course, there were no Nightmare Creatures inside at the second - just Sunny, Kai, and Slayer.\n\nThe Shrine was not exactly comfortable, but at least there was no ash falling on them from above. The smoke was contained in the middle of the great chamber, so the rest of it was clean, and even pleasantly cool. Kai studied their temporary shelter for a few seconds, then sighed.\n\n'Honestly, it is a bit of a downgrade compared to the houses you've been building. You are getting quite good at making those.' Sunny chuckled. 'Am I? That's good to hear.' He shook his head.\n'I spent most of my life being homeless, you know. So, in the end, I got myself a home that can follow me around… and eat my enemies…' He let out a wistful sigh. 'Who knew I wouldn't be able to bring it with me, this time?'\n\nSunny shook his head again and headed toward the pillar of smoke.\nApart from its form and size, the interior of the Shrine of Truth was different from the Ash Castle in two ways. First of all, since this volcano had just emerged, there was only a thin layer of ash on the floor. Secondly…\nSunny reached the circular pit leading to the depths of the volcano and stopped, looking at its edge with a thoughtful expression. 'I feel like I was right.'\n\nInstead of a single pedestal, there were two altars in front of the pit. If Sunny's suspicion was correct, they were meant for the jade figurines. One altar would allow him to exchange a Snow figure for a truth, while the other… the other would most likely allow him to sacrifice it in exchange for some kind of boon, either for himself or for his warriors. He was not going to decide how to spend his trophies just yet, though. First, he needed to learn the identity of the third Snow Abomination they would be fighting in two dawns.\n'Let's rest for a bit.'\n\nKai had commented how the Shrine of Truth was not that comfortable, but nothing prevented Sunny from making it more habitable. He manifested a few pieces of furniture and sprawled on a sofa, feeling a little satisfied by the fact that it felt far less weird than the previous ones. He had not slept inside Ariel's Game yet, and while there was no real need to, Sunny still felt himself drifting into a slumber. There would probably be no opportunity for him to rest later, so he could just as well use this last one.\nSleep did not come easily, though, and Sunny soon found himself laying there, wide awake, plagued by uninvited thoughts. Eventually, he sighed and sat up.\n\nKai was awake, too, looking at the billowing smoke with a distant еxpression. Sunny rubbed his eyes, then stared at the charming archer silently. 'Is something bothering you, Sunny?' He smiled crookedly. 'I guess.'\n\nSunny remained quiet for a few seconds, then said: 'You are a curious person. You know that, right, Kai?'\nThe charming archer raised an eyebrow and turned to look at him. 'Me? If anything, I thought that I was quite a boring person. Compared to my comrades, I mean.' Sunny scoffed.\n'Oh, but that is exactly what makes you curious. The fact that you are different from the rest of us.' Kai remained silent, as if inviting him to continue. Sunny leaned on the backrest of the sofa and sighed.\n'This armour I wear was forged by Nether, the Demon of Destiny. He is also known as the Demon of Choice. And here we are, searching for a piece of the Demon of Fate. Fate, destiny, choice… you might not know it, but all these things are of great interest to me.' He crossed his arms.\n'It used to be that very few people, apart from the Legacy scions, got to choose whether they wanted to be infected by the Nightmare Spell or not. They were forced to face the First Nightmare, and then, they were forced to enter the Dream Realm come the winter solstice. Some survived, and some didn't. However, once the carriers of the Spell Awakened… then, they finally got to choose something for themselves. Whether they wanted to challenge the Second Nightmare, or not.'\nSunny smiled darkly.\n'At least in theory. In truth, none of us had a real choice in that matter. For Nephis, it was the only way to survive and return to the waking world. For Effie, it was the only way to gain a healthy body. For Cassie, it was a necessary step toward fixing what she had broken. Mordret was a mirror wraith with no vessel to call his own. Jet had to keep growing stronger to survive her Flaw. As for me… well, I could not allow myself to fall behind someone.'\nHe pointed to Kai.\n'So, really… out of all of us, only you had that choice, Kai. You could have stayed Awakened and spent the rest of your life in safety, living comfortably. And yet, you still chose to answer the Call of Nightmare. So, I am curious… why?'\n\nKai seemed a little uncomfortable. He lingered for a few seconds, then shrugged.\n'I guess… I did indeed have the luxury of making more choices than most of my friends. At first, I did exactly what you said - stayed safe and lived comfortably, closing my eyes tо the sorrows of the rest. That was in the Bright Castle. But after escaping the Forgotten Shore, I did not want to live like that anymore.' He smiled.\n'Someone once told me - I don't quite recall who - that strength was the only virtue, while weakness was the only sin. It seemed convincing at first, but then, I changed my mind. Actually, having strength but misusing it felt like a far greater sin than being weak. I had already sinned by being weak, so after Awakening, I did not want to sin again by wasting my strength. So, I chose responsibility. I also chose to follow my friends, who did not have the same fгeedom of choice I had.'\n\nSunny leaned forward a little.\n'That is exactly it. You had freedom, but surrendered it in favor of responsibility.' His eyes grew darker. 'Don't you ever regret it? Don't you miss the freedom you gave up?'\nKai simply laughed.\nHis eventual answer made Sunny flinch a little.\n'No. I haven't missed it once.'"

    "title": "2355 Empty Vessel.docx",
    "content": "2355 Empty Vessel\n\nSunny studied Kai intently, hiding his surprise. He had expected his friend to give a negative answer, of course - after all, he knew Kаi too well to think otherwise. And yet the categorical nature of his denial left Sunny rattled.\n\nHe leaned back a little, frowning. 'Not… even once?'\n\nKai shrugged. 'Of course. This freedom you talk about… well, it is an elusive concept, I guess? It changes depending on how you define it. Are we talking about freedom from responsibility, from duty, from having to act on behalf of the others?'\n\nThe charming archer smiled softly. 'If so, then I see no reason to regret surrendering it. You seem to regard freedom as something inherently positive, but is it, reаlly? To me, it seems that freedom is neither good nor bad - rather, it is like a transparent, empty vessel. You can fill it with good things or bad things, making it either benign or malignant… but the very act of placing something in the vessel breaks it, and you're not free anymore. So, I guess it's a bit of a paradox.'\n\nHe sighed. 'The only way to remain free, in this context, is to leave the vessel empty. And while emptiness is neither benign nor malignant, it is certainly… much sadder than either.'\n\nKai shook his head. 'The things I filled my vessel with suit me fine. So what if it's not empty and transparent anymore? Why would I want to live a life of emptiness, anyway?'\n\nSunny slowly shook his head. 'I guess there's no reason, but still… doesn't everуone want to be free?'\n\nKai considered his question seriously. 'True, people generally long to be free - free to live their lives the way they want, that is, not to be free for the sake of freedom. So what they really want is freedom to make their own choices, not freedom from the consequences of those choices. Even if they become bound to something as a result, unable to do as they want anymore as a result.'\n\nSunny smiled bitterly. 'Ah… that old nugget of wisdom.' He remained silent for a while, looking into the distance somberly. 'Someone told me once that no one is really free in this world. Everyone is chained to someone, or something… so, the only real freedom there is is the freedom to choose your own chains.' He grinned darkly. 'Of course, I proved this wisdom wrong. Using your metaphor, I put the broken vessel back together and cleaned it until its walls were transparent once again.'\n\nKai raised an eyebrow. 'Peculiar. You are telling the truth, and yet, what you say can't possibly be true.'\n\nSunny was surprised. 'Can't possibly be true? How so?'\n\nNoticing his bewilderment, Kai chuckled. 'I mean… I might have some responsibilities, but they are really nothing compared to what you, Sunny, have chosen to bear. You volunteered to fight in the Domain War despite not having a stake in that fight, carried the weight of innumerable lives on your shoulders, faced a Sovereign in battle, and took his crown. Now, you are one of the two guardian angels of humanity… well, possibly a guardian devil is a more fitting term.'\n\nSunny's face twitched. 'Please don't mention angels when I'm around.'\n\nKai gave him a strange look, then shrugged and continued. 'What I mean to say is that you used to enjoy infinitely more freedom than I had ever possessed, and you discarded it all in favor of infinitely more responsibility than I will ever bear. So, how can you claim that your vessel is empty?'\n\nHe coughed and glanced away. 'Oh, and also, can we steer away from this whole empty vessel metaphor? Honestly, it's not one of my best… lyrics were never my strong suit, but still, I used to be a musician. So it's a bit embarrassing.'\n\nSunny blinked a couple of times. 'Sure, we can.'\n\nHe remained silent for a moment, then shrugged. 'Well, if you put it that way, there does indeed seem to be a contradiction. Actually, it was exactly as you said. I had strived to break free for a very long time, but when I finally did, it came at a cost. And what followed after… was empty and sad, You don't seem to regret surrendering your freedom, but I was full of regret after gaining mine. I was alone and had nothing, so I made a choice to come back and change everything. That, of course, bound me to a lot of things… and now, I feel compelled to see them through.'\n\nKai smiled. 'Then all is well, no? Since you chose that path yourself.'\n\nSunny sighed, then rubbed his face tiredly. 'It's not that easy. The path is long and winding… what if following it will rob me of the ability to make choices for myself in the future?'\n\nKai scratched the back of his head. 'Uh… to be honest, I lost track of all these metaphors a bit, so I am not sure I understand. But if the choice not to have as many choices is your own, then all is good, as well. I think?'\n\nSunny looked at him and smiled. Then, he laughed. 'So it's okay to be chained as long as I decide to wear shackles myself? All this talk, and we ended up where we began.'\n\nKai gave him a guilty look. 'Sorry if I wasn't helpful. But, in my defense… I have no idea what you are talking about.'\n\nSunny gave him a nod and laid back down on his sofa. 'It's alright. I appreciate you humoring me.'\n\nKai hesitated for a few seconds, then said in a tentative tone: 'Perhaps I could be more helpful if you told me what choice you are contemplating.'\n\nSunny yawned. 'Oh, it's just… I'm wondering whether I should go bird hunting sometime in the future. That's all.'\n\nKai opened his mouth, then closed it again. Then, he exhaled slowly. 'I see. Well, good luck with whatever you decide to do.'\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, he asked: 'Are you going to sleep? If so, I can stand guard. Not that nights here are dangerous.'\n\nSunny sighed, then shook his head. 'No… I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight. So, I'll do something else instead.'\n\nKai leaned back. 'What?'\n\nSunny smiled. 'Being here inside another one of Ariel's harrowing masterpieces has gotten me inspired. So, I am going to do some sorcery.' His smile grew darker. 'I am going to perform sorcery so grand and terrible that even daemons would have been impressed.'"

    "title": "2356 Grand Design.docx",
    "content": "2356 Grand Design\nSunny allowed his body to become a shadow, returning to his natural form. This time, however, he went a step further.\n\nLetting go of the familiar image of himself, he set the shadow free. Unleashed from the confines of a human silhouette, his shadow swelled and suгged in all directions, covering the spacious interior of the Shrine of Truth in an instant. Then, it burst from its gates like a dark tide.\nIn a matter of seconds, Sunny had become vast enough to swallow the entire volcano - up to the point where its slopes disappeared into the sea of clouds, at least. His shadow covered the gargantuan bowl of the caldera and the ash-covered slopes, flowing into each crack and crevice. He enveloped the luminous depths of the main vent, too, as well as the suffocating confines of the secondary fissure vents.\n\nSlayer shifted silently and placed a hand on the hilt of her sword. Kai simply glanced around, lingered for a few seconds, and closed his eyes to rest.\n\nSunny, meanwhile, summoned the shade of Abundance. The giant worm rose from the depths of his soul and bit into the rock, crawling through the solid mass of the volcano to a wide tunnel through it. The shades of Obsidian Wasps scurried behind it, clearing the tunnels of debris.\n\nSunny concentrated, and his vast shadow stirred, numerous arms growing from its black depths. His essence flowed like a torrent, and his countless hands wove it into black strings. He had considered for a long time what he would weave for the upcoming siege.\n\nIn truth… Sunny was not as confident in the outcome of the battle as he had made it look. Fighting three Snow figures, including a Demon, was a perilous task - especially considering how few advantages he had. The Crystal Wasps had been weakened when they attacked the Ash Castle. But that was because, at that point, the Ash Castles had been bordered by two squares of the same color. The Shrine of Truth, however, would be surrounded by the Snow Domain from all sides during the battle, which meant that the invaders would not be weakened that much, or perhaps at all. Sunny and his companions would not be suppressed either, unlike how they had been during the battles against the Ice Hive and Abundance, but that was all there was to it. The odds were not in their favor.\n\nSo, Sunny needed to prepare. And the Sacred soul shard that had fallen into his hands was one of two precious resources he had - the other being the jade figurines. What would be the best use for it? Should he create a deadly weapon for himself? A powerful charm that could be enhanced by the Jade Mantle? A tool that would allow him to pull off some insidious trick? There were numerous options, but none of them would be as impactful as he wanted. There was another problem, as well - time. A Sacred Memory was worthy of a truly sophisticated enchantment, but weaving an intricate enchantment was a long and complicated process. Sunny was not sure that he would be able to complete something so elaborate before the Snow figures descended upon the Shrine of Truth. So, the enchantment had to be relatively simple, just scaled to an entirely terrifying level of power.\n\nNo weapon, charm, or tool he could think of would be able to produce the results he needed while bound by these limitations. So, Sunny decided to do something else. He decided not to create a Memory at all.\n\nInstead… He decided to enchant the mountain itself. All of it, from the deepest part of the caldera to its steep, ash-covered slopes. The Sacred soul shard would serve as the core of his grand enchantment, while the tunnels Abundance created would become channels for the strings of shadow essence, forming the complicated patterns of an enormous spellweave. That spellweave would turn all of the fuming volcano into a magical fortress whеre Sunny would face the Cursed warriors of the Snow Domain, and slay them all one by one.\n\nOf course, creating such a spellweave was not an easy task. The paths carved by Abundance were crude when compared to what Sunny could weave when creating a Memory. So, he could only imbue the mountain with a relatively simple enchantment. But that was alright. He had just an enchantment in mind… a perfect solution to numerous of the problems facing him. The scale of forces involved was so distressing that Sunny could not be sure that his great masterpiece would survive a single battle. But that was alright, too… as long as it served its purpose, he would have a few more powerful shades to assist him during the next siege.\n\n'So much work…' He sighed silently. Controlling Abundance was difficult, commanding the Obsidian Wasps on top of that was straining, and he had to weave the strings of essence to boot. 'I better hurry, though.'\n\nThe night passed rapidly. In the morning, the Clockwork Giant and the Snow Demon both moved one square north, just like Sunny had predicted. And at the same time, a third figure arrived at the peak of the snowy mountain to the north, closing the blockade. It was another Snow Beast - one of the two who had been protecting the Snow Castle, it seemed.\n\nIgnoring the newcomer for the time being, Sunny concentrated on excavating the volcano and forming the grandiose spellweave. He had to control the flow of lava to prevent it from flooding the network of tunnels, but that had proven easy enough to accomplish with a bit of foresight. In the end, he managed to finish the enchantment with just a few hours to spare before the next dawn.\n\nAssuming the human form for the first time since his candid conversation with Kai, Sunny let out a long sigh and wiped the sweat off his brow. He was terribly tired. But there was no time to rest…\n\nStanding up, Sunny lingered for a moment, and then took out the two jade figurines from inside his armor. They lay on his palm, feeling cold to the touch. Sunnу exhaled slowly. \"Let's deal with you two, then.\""

    "title": "2357 Second Altar.docx",
    "content": "2357 Second Altar\nSlayer was where he had left her, standing silently in the darkness of the Shrine. Now that the sun had risen, a bit of light was falling into the empty hall of the scorched temple through the opening in its roof and the towering fissure of its gates - still, shadows swallowed most of the hall, so her motionless figure was entirely unnoticeable.\nNaturally, Sunny could see in the dark, so she could not hide from him.\n\nHe sighed.\nSlayer was a peculiar Shadow.\n\nShe had been a shadow of a mortal woman once. That woman perished, and her shadow traveled to the Shadow Realm like all shadows did… however, once there, she refused to be destroyed like the rest of them and persisted, hunting down the others like her to sustain herself. Whether it was because her sense of self was especially strong or for some other reason, Sunny did not know. In any case, her stubborn refusal to succumb eventually bore fruit. Slayer ceased to be a mere shadow, and was reborn as a Shadow Creature instead.\nThe passage of time had erased what little remained of her original self, turning her into the feral, ruthless huntress Sunny met - she did not even remember her own name, by then, let alone her past.\nShe was killed once more, and reborn again… this time, as his Shadow.\nSo, Slayer was neither human nor a creature, but something in between. She did not possess an Aspect like humans did, but she was also far more intelligent and lethal than a Beast was supposed to be.\n\nWhich was to say that she did not possess any special powers. All she had was her skills, her sharp intelligence, her frightening killing intent, and her stubborn will. It was with these tools that she had endured thousands of years of surviving in the Shadow Realm, crafting weapons and arrows from pieces of obsidian, preparing traps for her enemies, and hiding when an essence storm passed nearby.\nPerhaps that had not always been the case, though. She was a peculiar Shadow full of soul essence instead of shadow essence, after all - not quite Transcendent, but not quite Supreme either, perhaps Slayer had indeed wielded some kind of power, or even an Aspect, before her radiant soul deteriorated and lost its initial form.\nMaybe her Aspect could be recovered one day.\nIn any case, Sunny was not going to think less of her - or consider her less of a threat - simply because Slayer did not have any special powers. She was incredibly menacing even without them, after all, to which he could personally attest.\nStill, he was very curious to see how the Shrine of Truth would make her stronger.\n\nThe same held true for Kai… in fact, Sunny had no idea how the Shrine of Truth was supposed to work. All he knew was what Seishan had told them - that killing an enemy figure on this square was supposed to make the killer more powerful, somehow.\nAll of them desperately needed to grow more powerful, so that was really fortunate.\nThe fact that the jade figurines could seemingly substitute kills was, as well.\n'I wonder what Ariel's Game will do.'\nWould it grant them a sorcerous boon? Evolve the figure to a higher Class? Bestow magical weapons and equipment upon them?\nWould these boons be permanent, or would they disappear as soon as they left the board?\nHe was going to learn soon.\n\nJust as Sunny headed to the center of the Shrine, Kai descended from above, landed near him, and smiled.\n\"Sunny… are you done with your sorcery?\"\nSunny nodded and said, his voice both tired and satisfied:\n\"Yes. It turned out well, despite the difficulty. Ah, am I not a genius? Who else could have invented something so groundbreaking, huh?\"\nHe glanced at Kai with a hint of expectation, remained silent for a moment, then added:\n\"Groundbreaking. Get it?\"\nKai coughed suddenly.\n\"Oh… yes. The volcano has been shaking quite a lot. I was afraid there was going to be an eruption.\"\nSunny chuckled.\n\"That was just me excavating the mountain. Come, I'll explain what I did in detail a bit later.\"\n\nAs they walked toward the two altars, Slayer following silently from behind, Sunny gave Kai a curious look.\n\"You are back from observing the enemy, right? So, who is our guest from the north?\"\nKai frowned a little.\n\"Well… it is a Beast. However, it is not a single beast.\"\nSunny stopped for a second and blinked a few times.\n\"Don't tell me, are there another hundred of them?\"\nKai shook his head lightly.\n\"No. There sеems to be around a dozen - a pack. They look like ghostly wolves made of snow.\"\nSunny grinned.\n\"A pack? Finally, good news!\"\nThis might have been awful news, actually, but Sunny believed otherwise. He did not think that Cursed Ones were so plentiful as to travel in packs… so, the Snow Wolves had to be Great Beasts. Which meant that he would not have to battle three Cursed Nightmare Creatures at the same time.\n\"Great, great… the more, the merrier!\"\nSmiling brightly, he approached the two altars and studied them intently.\n\nThe one on the right looked almost identical to the altar in the Ash Castle. The one on the left, however, was quite different.\nIt might have had some runes and engravings carved into it once, but everything had been smoothed out and erased by the passage of time. Now, the altar was simply covered by soot.\nSunny could still see the indentation in the center of the altar, though, just the right size for a jade figure to fit.\nHe sighed.\n'Here goes my opportunity to learn two tantalizing truths…'\nIt was funny, really. He had expected the Shrine of Truth to be a place where one learned truths, but instead, he was going to sacrifice truths in order to gain power.\n\"Here, take this.\"\nHe handed one jade figurine to Kai, the other to Slayer.\n\nKai raised an eyebrow.\n\"Me? I thought you would try to strengthen yourself.\"\nSunny shook his head dismissively.\n\"I am plenty strong already - so, maybe later. The two of you need to become more useful right now, though.\"\nTaking a step back, he gestured to the altar.\n\"Come on. Put the Snow Beast figure on it.\"\nKai hesitated a little.\n\"So… uh… and what will happen when I do?\"\nSunny grinned.\n\"No idea! We'll know soon, won't we?\"\nKai frowned slightly.\n\"You're… not letting me go first just to see if something awful happens before trying it yourself, are you?\"\nSunny glanced at him with reproach.\n\"Of course not.\"\nHis smile returned.\n\"If that was my goal, I would have let Slayer go first!\"\nHe looked at Slayer, scratched the back of his, and added quietly:\n\"This definitely has nothing to do with the fact that, as a Shadow, she would be an unreliable test subject… believe me…\""

    "title": "2358 First Ring.docx",
    "content": "2358 First Ring\n\nWith a sigh, Kai walked over to the altar and placed the Snow Beast figure - the one they had retrieved after slaying Abundance - on its surface. Sunny watched him intently, wondering if the figure would still have to be tossed into the volcano. And how would it have worked if the Shrine of Truth belonged to the Snow Domain, instead? There would be no pit filled with smoke here if it had been, after all. However, he did not have to worry. Almost as soon as Kai placed the figure on the altar, it began to glow. Then, luminous fissures appeared on the surface of the flawless white jade, and a second later, it suddenly exploded into a swirling mass of ash.\n\n\"Huh…\"\n\nBefore either of them could react, the ash swirled around Kai… and then suddenly flowed right into him, disappearing into his chest. Neither Sunny nor Kai moved for a few moments. Eventually, Kai coughed and waved his hand in front of him. \"Great. More ash…\"\nHis expression was a little miserable. They had enough water to drink, but not enough of it to properly clean themselves. Considering the nature of the Ash Domain, with its pillars of smoke and ash constantly falling from the sky, that meant that Kai was constantly covered in smears of soot. The charming archer had managed to maintain a neat appearance even on the Forgotten Shore, so Sunny knew how much his friend was suffering. \"Kai… hey, Kai…\"\nThe charming archer turned and glanced at him bitterly. \"What?\"\nSunny sighed. \"Did you not notice? That cloud of ash did not just swirl around you. It went into you, you fool!\"\nKai blinked a couple of times. \"It did?\"\nSunny nodded. In fact, the whole process looked quite familiar. It was similar to how essence entered Awakened when they broke soul shards, to the point that Sunny was inclined to assume that Ariel had modeled the process to look the same.\n\nHe hesitated for a moment. \"How… how do you feel?\"\nKai looked into the distance, as if concentrating on the state of his body. Slowly, a startled expression appeared on his face. \"I feel… stronger. Much stronger.\"\nSunny studied him for a bit, then shifted his gaze and studied Kai's soul. Eventually, he said in a curious tone: \"Well, buddy, I don't know how to tell you this… but there's a ring of ash surrounding your soul core now.\"\nHe was, naturally, telling the truth. There, under his gaze, Kai's Transcendent soul core was shining brightly with breathtaking light. But now, there was a ring of ash suspended around it, many black flakes shining with reflected radiance. It looked very much like a planet surrounded by a thin ring system.\nPeculiarly enough, the soul essence that flowed in and out of Kai's core passed through the ring of ash first, assuming a new and peculiar quality.\n\nKai flinched. \"There's ash… inside me?\"\nHe looked like someone desperately wishing to take a shower. Sunny cleared his throat, then pattеd him on the shoulder. \"Relax. It's… mystical ash, not real ash. Point is, it's making you stronger, so all is good, right?\"\nKai let out a long sigh. Sunny studied him for a moment, then asked: \"But, more importantly… how much stronger is it making you, exactly?\"\nThe charming archer remained silent for a while, then said evenly: \"I am not entirely sure, but… I feel like I can crush a mountain.\"\nSunny grinned. \"How about you try crushing me, first?\"\nHe summoned a pedestal made of shadows and put his elbow on it, inviting Kai to an armwrestling match. After a brief struggle, the back of the charming archer's hand slammed into the pedestal, and he took a step back, massaging it with a pained expression. \"Ouch.\"\nSunny contemplated for a bit, then smiled. \"You're not exactly as strong as a Supreme Beast, but you are way stronger than a Transcendent should be now. Your essence has become more potent, and even your will seems to be receiving a boost. I can understand the former, but how the hell does the latter wоrk?\"\nNot only had Кai's will become more intense, but it also felt… familiar, somehow. Cold, and murderous. Quite unpleasant, really. Like the Will of a despicable, unhinged psychopath…\n'Wait.'\nThat was the flavor of Sunny's own will!\nHe blinked a couple of times, then stared at Kai again.\n'No, it actually makes sense?'\nKai was being enhanced by the Ash Domain, and who was the ruler of that Domain at the moment? It was Sunny! So the source of the force empowering Kai was not Ariel's Game itself, but the Ash Tyrant. The Ash Beast was being strengthened by the power of its ruler, with the laws of the miniature realm, and the ash itself, serving as intermediaries.\n'But if I am the master of the Ash Domain…'\nSunny extended his power outward, trying to form ash like he had always shaped shadows. To his surprise, it worked - a bit of ash гose into the air, solidifying into a crude effigy of a human. Allowing the effigy to crumble, Sunny peered into Kai's soul once more. 'If I can manipulate this ash, then won't I be able to influence that ash, as well?'\nAnd indeed, he felt a subtle connection. Using this connection, Sunny poured more of his will into the ring surrounding Kai's soul core. It accepted a bit, but rejected the rest, as if reaching its capacity.\n\nSunny looked up, studying Kai's face. \"And how much stronger do you feel now?\"\nKai moved his shoulders slightly. \"Hmm. I can't say that I feel any stronger. But… I am not quite sure how to explain it, but I do feel much deadlier.\"\nSunny remained silent for a while, staring at him with a neutral expression. Then, he grinned widely. \"That you are!\"\nWith that, he looked the other way. \"Slayer… Slayer! You turn now. Come on, put the figure on the altar!\"\nAs the same minor miracle happened to his Shadow, Sunny laughed. \"Great. Amazing! That is almost like a miniature, way more modest version of what happened to me once.\"\nKai gave him a hesitant look. \"And… what happened to you, exactly?\"\nSunny shrugged dismissively. \"Оh, nothing too insane. I just received a blessing by making a sacrifice on an altar once, too. Naturally, I did not have such handy jade figurines with me back then, so I had to sacrifice myself… good thing Shadow God was in the mood to rise from the dead for a second and bless me.\"\nKai sighed. \"Right. Nothing too insane. Indeed!\""

    "content": "2359 First Siege\n\nKai and Slayer had little time to get used to their new power… granted, Slayer had not required time for adjustment at all. She simply took the change that had happened to her because of the boon of ash in stride, as if remembering something she already knew instead of coming to terms with something new.\nThen again, she wasn't very expressive, so it was hard to tell what was on her mind.\n\n'Why am I always surrounded by stoic women?'\n\nSunny chuckled. Perhaps it was neither good luck nor bad luck, but simply a sign of the times. Considering the world they all lived in and the horrors Awakened faced, it was really not that surprising that there were a lot of strong, silent types walking around.\n'Couldn't be me…'\n\nKai, meanwhile, had spent the few hours left until sunrise training. He performed a variety of exercises and shot his bow hundreds of times, slowly getting used to his newfound strength. Sunny observed him, feeling like he was watching an intricate masterpiece of a machine tune itself to perfection.\nThen, the sky in the east finally brightened, and as the violent winds howled in the distance, a familiar snowstorm enveloped the world. Plumes of snow stretched toward the fuming volcano like tentacles, ready to turn into glass bridges as soon as the first ray of sunlight spilled over the horizon.\n\nSunny inhaled deeply.\n\"Get ready.\"\nHe felt a bit of trepidation in his heart.\nThis time, they were going to be attacked by three figures of the Snow Domain - a Cursed Demon, a Cursed Beast, and a pack of Great Beasts. Therefore, he had to split his forces to face all three threats simultaneously.\nSlayer and a number of Obsidian Wasps would be defending the north slope of the volcano against the Snow Wolves. Kai and the shadow of Abundance would defend the east slope against the Clockwork Giant. Sunny and the rest of his shades… were going to face thе Cursed Demon on the southern side of the mountain.\n\nThe odds were not in their favor, but thankfully, they did not have to defeat their fearsome enemies. All Sunny and his companions really had to do was hold the enemy back until the dawn exhausted itself. That said… Sunny had no intention of choosing a passive strategy. Only death was waiting for them that way.\n\nTrue, they could simply hold the enemy back, but that would simply mean facing the same threat tomorrow. And by tomorrow, their power would be diminished - they would be wounded, lacking essence, with fewer shades to help them in battle. The burden of consecutive battles would only mount after that, and sooner or later, it would crush them.\nSo, Sunny had to finish today's battle - and every battle after that - in a way that would leave him more powerful than he had been yesterday. That meant removing at least one Snow figure off the board, or better yet all of them. If he managed that, there would be new shades in his slowly growing army, and new jade figurines for his companions to sacrifice.\n'Let's hope things go according to plan.'\n\nSunny had an ace hidden up his sleeve, naturally - the grand enchantment he had woven into the mountain. But there were certain conditions that had to be met for his sorcery to work, and both he and his companions would have to work hard in order to make sure that it delivered the desired result.\nWhich was complete and utter annihilation, of course.\n\"What do you think, guys? Will we convince the Snow Tyrant not to underestimate us too much?\"\nHe looked at the Obsidian Wasps that surrounded him from both sides. Considering their size, Sunny had to crane his neck a little to look at their expressionless, gemlike eyes.\nTheir eyes were huge and compound, so he could see hundreds of his reflections staring bacк at him.\n…It was a good thing that Mordret wasn't around.\nIn any case, the Wasps did not respond, making him sigh in disappointment.\n\"I mean, who does that bastard take me for? Sending a mere Demon and two Beasts to kill me… how humiliating.\"\nHe forced out an unconvincing smile.\nOf course, Sunny knew that the Snow Tyrant was probably not trying to kill him seriously today. Rather, today's battle was merely meant to wound and exhaust the Ash Tyrant until the true elites of the Snow Domain arrived - the Devils, the Monsters…\n\nThe coming days would be quite eventful, to say the least.\nThis was one more reason why Sunny had to destroy as many Snow figures as he could this morning. The Shrine of Truth could only be attacked from three directions, but that did not mean that it could only be attacked by three figures. If more of them occupied the surrounding peaks, there could be up to ten horrors attacking the fuming volcano at the same time.\nActually, it was a bit peculiar that the Snow Tyrant had not employed that strategy already. So peculiar, in fact, that Sunny was starting to suspect that being able to bring several figures to a single square was a unique privilege of the Tyrants. After all, Slayer and Kai had never remained on a mountain without him…\nThat was something to consider, at least.\n\nAs Sunny did just that, the snow plumes finally solidified into ethereal bridges of glistening glass.\nThe golden light of dawn washed over the sea of clouds. It looked just as dreamlike and gorgeous as ever, but Sunny was in no mood to appreciate gorgeousness.\nInstead, he watched chillingly as a vast protuberance seemed to extend from the milky wall of the snowstorm, as if the blizzard itself was crossing the glass bridge.\nThat was the Cursed Demon coming to kill him under the cover of swirling snow.\n\"Ah, hell…\"\nSummoning the helmet of the Jade Mantle, Sunny reached into the shadows and pulled a black odachi from them.\nThe Obsidian Wasps seemed to tremble a little, as if shivering in the cold."

    "title": "2360 Leader of the Pack.docx",
    "content": "2360 Leader of the Pack\n\nOn the other side of the mountain, Slayer had begun her barrage. The pack of Great Beasts was rushing across the bridge, turning into billowing streams of snow from time to time - Sunny was not sure what Attributes the grotesque Wolves possessed, but they seemed quite elusive.\n\nHe did not sense any new shades entering his soul, at least, which meant that none of them had been slain by the arrows.\n\nOn the eastern slope of the volcano, Kai sent an arrow flying, as well. Sunny heard it fly - this one was quite unique, having been crafted specifically for the charming archer. Its enchantment allowed him to imbue the arrowhead with sound, which allowed Kai to record his commands and deliver them from a distance. In other words, the arrow carried his mystical voice.\n\nFar away, the Clockwork Giant had already stepped onto the glass bridge. The singing arrow struck him square in the chest… and powerlessly bounced away, not dealing the Cursed Beast any damage.\n\nThat was just as Sunny had expected.\n\nEmpowered by the boon of ash and Sunny's own deathly will, Kai might have been able to wound some other Cursed being. But the brass giant glanced like a thing that had been created specifically to be sturdy and resilient… practically indestructible.\n\nSunny had known that this particular adversary would be too tough to be pierced by arrows, enchanted or not. That was the very reason why he had sent Slayer to fight the Snow Wolves - the nature of the malevolent training dummy made it impervious to most of her arsenal.\n\nIn fact, it was probably impervious to most anything, which was why Kai with his rattling sonic attacks and Abundance with its sheer mass were a better choice. Even if they were not able to destroy the Cursed Beast, they would at least be able to stall him.\nSunny was not at all ashamed to use the easy, but effective powers of Abundance to his advantage. A dumb meat shield was a perfect foil for an indestructible adversary. He was actually most worried about himself.\n\nUnlike his two companions, Sunny did not try to attack the Snow Demon on the bridge. He just waited patiently, watching as the blizzards rushed toward the volcano at great speed.\n\n\"Ah. This thing just had to go and make me angry…\"\nSunny had not felt any personal animosity toward the Cursed Demon before seeing it advance just now. That was because any creature using a veil of snow as cover reminded him of Winter Beast.\n\nAnd although Sunny had already killed that Titan, he still carried quite a lot of spite toward it and its ilk in his heart.\n\"Come here, then.\"\n\nFinally, the billowing mass of snow reached the slope of the volcano and enveloped it in bitter cold.\nThis was Sunny's territory, though. This was his Domain.\nAs soon as the blizzard - and the thing hiding within it - reached the ashen ground, the shadows surged. Darkness swallowed the entire southern side of the volcano, and the ash rose into the air, mixing with the snow.\nThe ash remained, but the snow turned black and melted, disappearing without а trace. Even the cold winds were suffocated.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, the blizzard was no more.\n\nAnd once it was gone, the wraith that had been hiding within it was revealed, standing motionlessly in the hurricane of ash.\nSunny smiled darkly.\n\",Unexpected.\"\nWhat faced him was a frozen corpse.\n\nIt was the corpse of an enormous wolf, its rotten fur as white as snow. There were innumerable crude spears sticking out of its desiccated hide like a palisade, the spearheads carved roughly from flint and obsidian.\nThe Cursed monstrosity had three eyes, each burning with malеvolent, crimson flames… the sight of them reminded Sunny of the primordial hunter Jet had slain once, an eternity ago, in front of the Nightmare Gate in NQSC.\nThat Gate Guardian had worn a skill with three empty eyes as a helmet, too. Sunny had suspected that most of the Nightmare Creatures trapped in Ariel's Game had been collected by the daemons in the frozen wastelands west of the Jade Palace.\n\nIf so, he could imagine the corpse of the appalling wolf being encased in ice after dying to the spears of the primordial humans of the bygone era… only to become possessed by a malevolent spirit thousands of years later and emerge from it as a vengeful wraith.\nHad it been an appalling predator who hunted primal humans and feasted on their flesh? Had it been a guardian Spirit of a human tribe whom the hunters from a different one had slain to eradicate the adversary? Had it hunted alone, or had it led other predators like a bestial deity?\n\nSlayer was fighting the pack of wolves on the northern slope of the volcano right now, but this one - this one might have been the leader of the pack.\nOr possibly their god.\nIn any case, Sunny was going to have to face this primordial horror in battle.\n\nThe three harrowing eyes of the wolf glanced at Sunny, and he felt his very soul shiver and shudder under their gaze. The pressure that descended upon him was suffocating, and he felt something that he had not felt in a long time.\nA primal, utterly irrational, overwhelming fear rising to drown his wildly beating heart.\nThe fear that prey instinctively felt when facing a predator.\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"Hey, you… who do you think you are?\"\nHe took a step forward, walking between the Obsidian Wasps. Then, he pointed to the ground with the tip of his odachi.\n\"This here is my volcano. So, I suggest you tuck your tail and run.\"\n\nInstead of answering, the Cursed Demon lowered itself to the ground and let out a dreadful growl. Sunny felt a cold shiver run down his spine, and his very soul shook, as if straining to remain intact.\n\nHe was quite certain that this malevolent growl alone could have snuffed out the souls of many humans of a lesser Rank - mundane people, Awakened… possibly even Masters. Saints would be left paralyzed and writhing in agony after being exposed to this malice…\nHe grimaced.\n\"Very well. Come closer, then… I'll give you the honor of becoming the second god I've slain.\""

    "content": "2361 As Old and as True as the Sky\n\nThe wolf lunged forward.\n\nAs it did, the world itself seemed to crumple and shrink, the space folding on itself as the Cursed Demon tore through. Sunny felt it in his bones - an alien, violent presence invading his Domain, its boundless ferocity pushing against the brittle walls of his authority, making them rattle and crack.\n'Not… so quick…'\n\nSunny gritted his teeth and pushed back, asserting his will over the dark expanse of the towering volcano. As he did, the surrounding space became less pliable and more indomitable, as it was meant to be.\nSo what if the Snow Demon was a god? Sunny was a Sovereign within the bounds of his Domain. He was the ultimate authority here, and a mere Cursed One was not powerful enough to assert dominance over his kingdom.\nThe three-eyed wolf might not have been weakened by the Ash Domain because the Shrine of Truth was surrounded from all sides by snowy peaks, but it was still an invader here. The rules of Ariel's Game were not helping Sunny, but the laws of existence were - any adversary would be at a great disadvantage when attacking a Supreme within their Domain.\nEspecially if that Supreme was a Titan.\nAs Sunny's titanic will clashed with the will of the Snow Demon, the distressing advance of the latter slowed down - enough so, at least, for the Obsidian Wasps to rush down the slope and intercept the wolf before it could leap аt Sunny.\n\nThe shades moved in harmony with each other, assembling into a crescent phalanx as they scurried down the slope at great speed - some moving on the ground, some jumping into the air and unfolding their translucent wings to fly. Sunny was getting better and better at commanding his shades, so this kind of intricate control was not beyond him anymore.\nThe Wasps were meant to break the Snow Demon's momentum, stall it, and attack it from both sides - opening it up for the punishing attack by Sunny himself.\nHowever, before they could descend upon the grotesque fiend, the figure of the giant wolf suddenly burst into a hurricane of snow. The billowing white wall swallowed the front rows of the shades and simply… erased them from existence, each snowflake cutting into glossy obsidian like a razor-form blade.\nSunny lost dozens of his Obsidian Wasps in an instant.\n\nFeeling concerned, he quickly called the rest of them back and thrust his odachi deep into the ground.\nA web of fractures shot through the slope of the volcano from the point where the black blade pierced the rock, and in the next moment, roaring geysers of luminous lava shot from under the ground, making the raging snow shinе with a gorgeous red glow.\n\nThe Snow Demon coalesced into its bestial form once more, jumping over the fiery fissures to tear into the гetreating shades. Its awful maw opened аnd closed, easily crushing several of them between the jade fangs in one bite.\nThe rest of the Obsidian Wasps escaped into the air, circling around the Cursed Nightmare Creature like a swarm.\n\nBy now, Sunny knew that his shades would not be able to buy him much time… but they could still buy him a second or two to think, at least.\n'I wonder…'\nSunny had not fought a lot of Cursed Nightmare Creatures just yet, but he already suspected that each of them embodied some kind of concept - or at least wielded one as a weapon.\nThe Snow Worm, Abundance, was the easiest example. The name Sunny had given it was also its essence. That Cursed Beast had used the concept of infinity to make itself inexhaustible, indestructible, and inevitable… until it had met an inglorious end by Sunny's hand.\nWhat concept did this Cursed Demon embody, then? What was the weapon it used?\n\nThen again… Beasts were easy creatures by definition. Demons, meanwhile, were beings of a far higher order and sophistication. They were cunning, insidious fiends whose dreadful malice was borne of keen intelligence. So, possibly what a Cursed Demon embodied was incomparable to the easy nature of Abundance.\n'Who is this adversary of mine?'\nSunny felt that victory or defeat, as well as his very survival, depended on finding a correct answer to this question.\nThe creature in front of him… had been a bestial Spirit once. A primordial predator who had hunted the first humans at the dawn of time, only to fall to their flint spears when the humans learned to be hunters instead of prey.\nPerhaps it had been corrupted by the Void back then, already. Perhaps it had been a benevolent guardian Spirit of a human tribe before falling prey to human malice and being reborn as a harrowing wгaith. In any case…\nIt was truly ancient. It was a being from before history existed, having been born and slain in the age when even the gods were young, let alone the world they had created. A horror from the beginning of… everything.\nSo, wasn't Sunny's thinking too constricted by the complexities of the modern era?\n\nHe felt something - a hint of an intuitive understanding. It came from the primal fear he had felt when the Snow Demon's gaze fell upon him.\nWhy did the grotesque wolf have to embody a concept of anything?\nWhy couldn't it just be the embodiment of a… wolf?\nOf the Wolf. The first, or perhaps the most flawless member of their storied tribe.\nSunny shifted faintly, watching the Wolf eviscerate the swarm of hapless Supreme shades.\n\nIf his enemy was indeed the embodiment of the concept of a wolf, then it was already at a deadly disadvantage. It was alone, after all…\nWhile the true strength of a wolf was the pack.\nJust as Sunny thought that, a litany of dreadful howls resounded from the other side of the volcano, where Slayer was fighting the Great Beasts - the Snow Wolves.\nHe paled.\n\",Crap.\"\nAt that moment, he knew that he had to prevent the Wolf from uniting with the pack of lesser Beasts on the northern slope of the volcano at all costs.\nAnd he also knew something else.\nHis odachi rippled and elongated, turning into a black spear, Sunny dismissed most of his armor and aimed his spear at the distressing demon.\nIf his enemy was truly the source and embodiment of all wolves…\nThen who was its greatest adversary?\nNaturally… it was the hunter."

    "title": "2362 Hunter and Prey.docx",
    "content": "'2362 Hunter and Prey\nThe ultimate adversary of a wolf was the hunter, and therefore, if Sunny wanted to resist the primordial demon who embodied the concept of the Wolf, he had to embody the concept of the Hunter.\n\nTo the best of his ability, at least.\n\nThat statement sounded like an inspirational adage, but actually, there was nothing abstract or philosophical about it. Instead, it was strictly a matter of cold practicality. At the level of power where Sunny had found himself, the physical battle between two creatures was merely an expression of the violent clash between their wills, their spirits… their essences. An ultimate expression, true, but still only an outward one - no more than the tip of the iceberg.\n\nSo, channeling a concept that was both superior and in direct opposition to the essence of his adversary would help Sunny resist their Will better, empowering his own against the foe. At least that was what he hoped and expected to happen - obviously, Sunny had never attempted a technique like that before. He had never even thought to think about such a technique before, let alone implement it. Luckily, Sunny had several vital advantages as far as channeling the concept of the Hunter went.\n\nFirst of all, he was a hunter - one of the most accomplished hunters of mankind, no less. The number of powerful Nightmare Creatures he had hunted was almost incalculable, and there were few people in the world more knowledgeable about how to stalk prey. Secondly, he had witnessed the primordial hunters from the era of the Wolf once, a long time ago. Not only had he witnessed and battled them, but he had also learned their primal, ruthless battle style - he even used it when sparring with Morgan during the Southern Campaign, increasing his familiarity with the combat techniques of those prehistoric humans.\n\nAnd lastly, Sunny was a master of Shadow Dance. That power of his allowed him to learn the essencе of the enemy and assume their form, but even if there was no adversary for him to shadow - or if he did not dare to shadow anyone due to the fear of losing his unmoored, untethered self - he still had a great wealth of experience channeling the mindset and physicality of someone other than himself. Of becoming someone else, even. Shadows were a malleable sort, after all. So, even if Sunny had never attempted to channel an opposing concept to gain an advantage in a battle of Wills with a superior adversary, he was still sufficiently confident that he could pull it off.\n\nFlying down the slope of the volcano while the Wolf was distracted by the Obsidian Wasps, Sunny steeled his mind. 'Feel it…' As Sunny lunged forward, the tip of his spear slicing the fabric of the world apart, he imagined himself as someone else. His imagination summoned a vision from the depths of his being, and submitting to his will, that vision came true. He could almost feel it… he did feel it. The chill of the early morning as he left his crude hut, its walls made of rough hide. The drops of dew trembling on the blades of grass. The smell of fresh blood in the air. The cries of his kin, the ghastly sight of a body ravaged by beasts. The wolves had attacked his tribe in the night, stealing a life. The anger, the sorrow… the hunger. The dark malice in the eyes of his fellow tribesmen, who glanced at him for guidance. He was the best hunter among them, after all… their leader. Their chieftain. The familiar weight of his spear as they headed toward the woods, the polished texture of its well-worn shaft, the wicked sharpness of its flint blade.\n\nWith this spear, he was going to kill the Wolf. He was going to kill it because it had dared to prey on his kin, because it had dared to hunt in his territory. 'Haa…' Sunny could feel his blood growing hotter, running faster. His eyes glinted with harsh, murderous light. His clear mind was engrossed with the channeled image, his movements turning sharp and economical, devoid of elegance or grace. His Will had become different, as well. It changed to fit the essence of a fearless, ruthless Hunter.\n\nIn the next moment, Sunny was upon the Wolf. His spear lashed out, aiming for the beast's glowing, malevolent eyes, bringing with it the absolute finality of Death… However, the Wolf was a ferocious and cunning predator, as well. It was larger than Sunny, stronger than Sunny, faster than Sunny… it was hungrier than Sunny, too. It avoided the spear easily, leaping away and letting out a fearsome growl. The distressing gaze of its three crimson eyes pierced him, penetrating into his very soul. And suddenly, Sunny was little and weak. He was prey paralyzed by fear.\n\nThe ash billowed around him, and before the Wolf could lunge forward again, Sunny disappeared into the shadows and stepped out of them somewhere else, his ruthless spear piercing the Wоlf's side. \"I…\" The ancient fiend whined and exploded into a storm of obliterating snow, retreating down the slope of the volcano to take shape again.\nSunny took a step forward and aimed his spear at the Cursed Demon once again. His lips twisted into a vicious grin. \",am no one's prey.\" The Wolf stared at him with madness and hatred for a split second, and then rushed forward in a hurricane of rabid killing intent.\nSunny met the beast with the tip of his spear, and at the point where they clashed, the slope of the volcano fractured, innumerable tons of ash and rock sliding down into the sea of clouds.\n\nA deafening thunderclap sent the clouds rippling, and the world shook, hurt by the violence of the cataclysmic forces they had unleashed. Neither Sunny nor the Wolf paid it any attention, though, having turned into a rolling, distressing whirlwind of destruction. The two of them were intertwined in a frightening dance of death, and nothing could withstand the lethal horror of their primal fury.\nThe towering volcano shuddered."

    "title": "2363 Shattered Rock.docx",
    "content": "2363 Shattered Rock\nThe mountains of Ariel's Game were titanic, towering much higher than any peak on Earth. They were impressively rugged and durable, as well, nearly indestructible - theу had to be, considering that each was meant to become an arena for tremendously powerful beings.\n\nAnd yet, in everу battle Sunny had fought in this miniature realm, the mountain in question would inevitably be damaged. The two clashes with the Ice Hive and the harrowing battle against Abundance had resulted in dreadful devastation.\n\nBut even that level of destruction paled in comparison to what was happening to the Shrine of Truth volcano now that six figures - three figures of Ash and three figures of Snow - had collided on its slopes.\nThe unimaginable scale of the unraveling calamity contrasted peculiarly against the dreamlike, glowing gorgeousness of the gilded clouds below. The billowing black veil of ash above was illuminated by the golden glow of the rising sun, as well, contributing to the striking sight.\n\nBetween the gorgeous white gold of the clouds and the elegant black gold of the ash, a scene of utter devastation was taking place.\n\nOn the southern slope, an immense mass of shattered rock had collapsed into the sea of clouds. The ground was torn by wide fractures, and rivers of lava were flowing down the weathered stone, spilling into the milky veil of swirling mist. The calamity was only just beginning, as well - Sunny and the Wolf had intertwined into an obliterating whirlwind, slowly moving toward the caldera as they left a trail of destruction in their wake.\n\nOn the northern slope, the Snow Wolves had reached the end of the glass bridge. This was the natural bottleneck they had to be brave if they wanted to step onto the ash-covered surface of the volcano, so that was where the phalanx of the Obsidian Wasps met them, scurrying forward to keep the enemy away from Slayer.\nThe Snow Wolves were quite cunning, though. Instead of colliding with the orderly battle formation of the insect-like shades, they turned into a rushing mass of snow and tried to bypass them - these Great Beasts were intelligent enough to know that the lethal archer hiding behind the Obsidian Wasps was the true threat, and so, they were determined to deal with Slayer first.\n\nTheir attempt had been spoiled, though, when the Wasps unfolded their translucent wings. A hurricane wind was raised by the beating of the obsidian wings, pushing the avalanche of snow back and arresting its advance.\nThe Snow Wolves had no choice but to assume corporeal forms and descend upon the shades in all their bestial fury. Scarlet eyes glowed viciously as they bit into the glossy obsidian and shattered it with their paws, shattering several Wasps in an instant.\nThe Wasps were shades of Supreme Beasts, and there were more of them than there were Snow Wolves… however, shades were inherently weaker than their living counterparts, and these Great Beasts seemed far more powerful than each individual Crystal Wasp had been.\nStill, the clash of so numerous beings of the Supreme and Great Ranks was nothing short of distressing, producing almost as much violent destruction as the battle between Sunny and the Wolf did. The northern slope shook almost as much as the southern one, and sharp pieces of stone flew in every direction like shrapnel.\n\nFissures and cracks appeared on the surface of the weathered rock, and the mountain seemed to groan. Its titanic edifice shuddered in pain.\nThe Obsidian Wasps seemed to disintegrate under the vicious assault of the Snow Wolves, but they fought with the tactical awareness and precision of a well-trained army unit - what they lacked in strength and fеrocity, they made up for with seamless coordination and unity. That was only possible because Sunny commanded them with an intricate level of control, naturally.\n\nOne of the shades fell, shattered in the maw of the towering white wolf, but that gave two more just enough time to bite into the wolf's legs with their obsidian mandibles.\n…And that, in turn, gave Slayer just enough time to draw her bow.\nNow that the wolves were not rushing across the bridge but were instead bogged down in the crumbling phalanx of Obsidian Wasps, they were easy targets. A black arrow flashed through the air and sank into the wolf's rabid eye - in the next moment, the entire upper half of the beast exploded into a bloody mess. The Great Beast fell down, its body crumbling into snow and ice.\n\nOn the eastern slope, the indomitable Clockwork Giant stepped onto the ash. Its stiff motions were measured and inevitable, and the world itself seemed to be bending around him, as if pushed by the crushing mass of the Cursed Beast's heavy presence.\nThe giant glanced up, at the huge body of Abundance that was already descending upоn him like an avalanche of black flesh. His sword rose like the blade of a guillotine and fell down, cleaving through the enormous worm's neck.\n\nEven the great sword's immense length was nоt enough to cut cleanly through it, though. And even though the cut delivered by the Clockwork Giant extended far beyond the brass blade of his sword, leaving a huge scar on the face of the mountain, Abundance refused to be beheaded.\n\nInstead, the giant was buried under the endless flesh of the worm shade. The volcano shook and shook from the cataclysmic impact, a hurricane of ash rising into the air as the weathered rock split and turned to dust.\n\nThe surface of the volcano broke, but the indomitable brass giant did not. Instead, it simply carved his way through the flesh of Abundance, emerging on the other side with mechanical, unfeeling malevolence.\nAs soon as it did, a sonic wave crashed into him violently, making the ancient metal rattle and pushing the Cursed Beast back.\nHigh above, a dark dragon was soaring among the ash, its eyes shining with a gorgeous silver light.\n\nKai was a Saint, and Saints were not supposed to battle Cursed Ones.\nHowever, he was strengthened by the boon of ash and emboldened by Sunny's own deathly will.\n\nSo, today, he could achieve things he would not have been able to achieve otherwise.\nLike, for example…\nMeaningfully affecting a Sacred shade with the mystical power of his voice.\nNo sooner than the Clockwork Giant staggered back into the coils of Abundance, an eerily gorgeous voice thundered from above:\n\"CRUSH HIM!\"\nAnd suddenly, the giant found it much harder to escape from the endlessness of the black worm than before.\n\nThe mountain shuddered, breaking apart, as the Cursed abominations and the Sacred shade clashed on its slope, the breathtaking dragon unleashing the annihilating power of its songs on the shattered slope.\nThe sun crawled slowly from behind the horizon."

The world had turned half - red, and the shaft of his spear was slippery in his hand.\nOf course, the smell of blood only made him hunger to kill his adversary more.\nThe only thing he regretted was that the Wolf did not shed blood, as well, despite being cut and mangled by his spear - the vile thing was a corpse, after all, and corpses rarely bled.\nSunny himself was not a corpse, but he was not in the habit of bleeding either. Today was the exception to the rule, though, because of who his adversary was. The Wolf was the epitome of a predator, and therefore, everything that it hunted was prey… was supposed to be prey.\nAnd it was the nature of the Wolf's prey to bleed.\nTo be mangled, torn, and devoured.\nSunny found himself struggling to push against the confines of being prey - of having this concept be forced upon him by the Will of the Wolf - and therefore, Blood Weave was cowering in fear of the malevolent spirit.\nOf course, he was not bleeding as much as a normal person would - if he did, he would have turned into a corpse himself already. His Will was resisting the Cursed Demon viciously, and to great success. That was why Sunny was still alive, that was why the Wolf could not move freely on the slope of the volcano, and that was why the harrowing fiend had more wounds on its body than Sunny did.\nAnd the reason why Sunny's Will was so effective against the Will of a being that was far more ancient, far more powerful, and far more frightening than him was, in large part, because he did not wield it blindly.\nHe wielded it as a swordsman would a sharp blade, with finesse and precision. He had donned the essence of the Hunter, too, making that weapon uniquely suited to fight against the Wolf.\nSunny pierced the Cursed Demon with his spear, scorched him with lava, and set his Obsidian Wasps upon it like hunting dogs. He poisoned its soul with Death Will, smothered it with ash, and chained it with manifested shadows.\nHe broke its fangs and shattered its bones, slamming the giant Wolf into the slope of the volcano with the power of a Supreme Titan. He made sure that every step the vile fiend made inside his Domain cost more than it could afford to pay.\nAnd pay it would…\n\"Argh!\"\nBarely blocking the swipe of an enormous paw with the shaft of his spear, Sunny was tossed back.\nThe Wolf moved with speed which made the concept of time meaningless. The world - those parts of it that were not pushed by Sunny's own will - seemed still. Flakes of ash were frozen in the air, and fountains of lava had turned into glowing statues.\nThe sun stood motionless, half - hidden behind the horizon.\nFeeling the iron taste of blood on his tongue, Sunny wanted to laugh.\nHe had wanted to hold out until the dawn exhausted itself, hadn't he?\nThat hope seemed senseless now. At the speed with which he and the Wolf were moving, the dawn might as well have been eternal.\nLanding on the jagged rocks, Sunny slid on the ash and righted himself with the butt of his speаr.\nThe Wolf was already upon him, and there was no time to evade.\n'You damn grotesque monstrosity…'\nSunny did not have time to evade, and he did not even have time to dive into the shadows. So, he did not even try. Instead, a split second - whatever that meant now - before the Wolf's inescapable jaws snapped shut across his torso, he simply turned into a shadow himself.\nIt did not matter for a Cursed Demon whether its enemy was tangible or intangible, so Sunny kept himself manifested as a clump of matter - a formless mass of darkness that was pushed by the fiend's snout like fabric. Instead of biting him in two, the Wolf simply got entangled in him, carrying both of them hundreds of metres up the slope with its lunge.\nThen, Sunny imbued his formless body with the weight of a mountain, pushing the Wolf down.\nHis spear was hopelessly beyond reach now… but that was alright.\nBecause there were a hundred perfectly fine spears sticking out of the creature's back, their ancient flint blades still retaining their lethal edges.\nA hundred hands rose from the formless mass of darkness entangling the Cursed Demon and grasped the shafts of the ancient spears, rending them out of the Wolf's hide and then plunging them back with vicious strength.\nThe Wolf let out a distressing, soul - destroying howl.\nAnd tore into Sunny's formless body, shredding it apart with its fangs and its claws.\nThe pain was blinding. Everything about Sunny - his body, his soul, his spirit - was being torn apart.\nBut he simply laughed, continuing to stab the rabid beast with the hundred flint spears. Some of them broke, but more remained intact, piercing deeper and deeper into the fiend's flesh… More still plunged into its shadow, rending it to shreds.\nThe Wolf fell and rolled, crushing Sunny under its weight.\nBoth of them were receiving grievous wounds, but Sunny knew that the Wolf would easily outlast him. There would be only one winner in this reckless exchange of mortal wounds, and it was not going to be the human.\nThe volcano shuddered once more, another section of the southern slope becoming utterly pulverized and broken.\nIn fact, most of the southern slope was simply gone, by now.\nThe eastern slope looked better, but not by much. Abundance was on the verge of collapsing there, and Kai was battering the indestructible brass giant with sonic blasts to buy the huge worm a little bit more time.\nSlayer had managed to slay a few more Snow Wolves on the northern slope, but most of the Obsidian Wasps were already gone. She had to abandon her bow and unsheath her blades, slicing open the throat of a lunging Beast as she dove beneath it.\nThe terrain of the volcano had completely changed, the very landscape being reshaped by the frightening battle. It almost felt like the entire mountain was ready to collapse.\nDrowning in pain, bloodlust, and fury, Sunny thought chillingly…\n'It should be time, shouldn't it?'\nHe would have smiled if he had a mouth.\nThe spear, after all, was not the only weapon of a hunter.\nThe hunter's best tool was a trap."

    "content": "2365 Lured Into a Trap\n\nSunny was wounded. The Wolf was wounded more.\n\nIt was because Sunny was defending his Domain while the Wolf was invading it. It was also because Sunny was especially tenacious, while the Wolf was simply furious.\n\nPlus, Sunny fought with a spear, the purpose of which was to keep the fangs of the enemy away from his body. The Wolf, however, fought with its body - so, naturally, its body had received more damage than Sunny's own. But that was not going to last much longer.\n\nAt the end of the day - even though the time seemed frozen and the day showed no sign of ever progressing, let alone coming to an end - Sunny was still much weaker than the Cursed Demon. He could have defeated it in combat, possibly, if there were no other figures attacking the Shгine of Truth at the same time. But as things stood, his temporary advantage was rapidly coming to an end. Soon enough, the balance of power between them would be broken and reversed, and when that happened, Sunny was going to be ripped apart by the fangs of the harrowing Wolf. He would become its meal. So, there was no point in continuing their calamitous fight.\n\nLuckily, he had accounted for his lack of strength in advance and prepared a trap.\n\nThe trap he had built was quite a simple one, but also quite devious. I'm Sunny knew that he going to weaker than his enemies… even his sorcery would be weaker than them, no matter how intricate of a weave he wove.\nSo, he needed to borrow power from somewhere to deal with his enemies. But where would he borrow power to kill Cursed abominations?\n\nAfter thinking for some time… Sunny had decided to borrow that power from the Cursed abominations themselves.\n\nThere had been no time to create a truly complicated spell, but the one he wanted to enchant the mountain with was relatively simple. All Sunny had to do was scale it to titanic proportions and invent a way to etch the spellweave into a towering volcano instead of a Memory.\n\nThe enchantments he wove belonged to a shield he had received as one of the Dream Tournament rewards courtesy of its sponsor, the Great Clan Valor, only to use it later to kill one of the Valor Knights in the Night Temple. Both Sunny and Saint had used that shield well in the Kingdom of Hope - later, it was inherited by Quentin, whom it served faithfully in Antarctica and the second Nightmare. The gallant Master was still using it, in fact.\n\nThat shield was no other than Patient Avenger, and its enchantments were called [Burning Heart] and [Cold Steel].\n\n[Burning Heart] Enchantment Description: \"This shield can store a portion of fire damage it receives to enhance another weapon of its wielder or unleash a destructive shockwave.\"\n\n[Cold Steel] Enchantment Description: \"This shield can store a portion of impact damage it receives to enhance another weapon of its wielder or unleash an immolating wave of fire.\"\n\n…As Sunny had already noted, the mountains of Ariel's Game were incredibly sturdy. And yet, they were on the verge of toppling after each titanic battle, since the forces unleashed by the clashing figures were simply too awful. How could they not be, when literal gods were fighting on the weathered slopes?\n\nSo, Sunny had enchanted a fire - breathing mountain in a way that allowed it to absorb the damage it received, store it… and then unleash it in one distressing, world - ending conflagration.\n\nTo be precise, he had enchanted the volcano to incinerate everything and anyone touching its surface.\n\n'Haa…' As the Wolf shredded Sunny's formless body furiously, repeatedly slamming it into the fractured, crumbling slope, he exhaled slowly.\n\n'Am I not a genius? No, but really?' He would have laughed if he could.\n\nAny other enchantment would have needed time to collect charge, which would have doomed Sunny because of how rapid the battle was progressing. However, the enchantments derived from the Patient Avenger he had woven into the mountain did not depend on time… they only depended on the amount of damage dealt to the mountain.\nThe faster the Wolf, the pack of its lesser kin, the Clockwork Giant - as well as Sunny, Slayer, Kai, Abundance, and the Obsidian Wasps - moved, the fiercer their battles were, the more damage they dealt to the volcаno. And the more damage was dealt to the volcano, the more of it absorbed, hastening the moment when the enchantment would reach critical mass.\n\n'It's time, now. I think,' Sunny was ready to spring his trap on the wounded Wolf.\n\nThe formless, hundred - handed mass of darkness tore all of the flint spears from the body of the Cursed Demon, ripping its white fur.\n\nAnd then… it simply dissolved into the shadows.\n\nSunny sent himself to the Shrine of Truth. At the same time, Slayer was pulled into the shadows, as well, appearing next to him in a stagger. If the murderous Shadow was surprised by suddenly being taken out of the fight, she did not show it - if anything, she seemed dissatisfied by the fact that Sunny had robbed her of the chance to kill more wolves.\n\nKai had just landed on the shattered rock a split second ago to avoid a world - severing strike of the Clockwork Giant's sword. He was pulled into the shadows, too, and there was suddenly a giant dragon in the vast hall of the Shrine. The surviving Obsidian Wasps and the shade of Abundance were dismissed, leaving only the Snow abominations on the slopes of the volcano.\n\nThat was quite a dangerous situation - not only because the enemies could converge freely on the caldera, but also because the Wolf could unite with the pack of Great Beasts, regaining its greatest strength. But, naturally, Sunny was not planning to give the nightmare creatures a chance to meet.\n\nAssuming his human form and falling to his knees, awash in blood, he grinned wildly. And sent a pulse of essence into the scorched floor of the ancient Shrine, activating his spell."

    "content": "2366 Grand Enchantment\n\"Brace yourselves!\"\nSlayer sank one of her swords into the floor of the temple, while Kai crouched low to the floor. The sight of a crouching dragon was peculiarly magnificent, but also slightly comical - Sunny had no time to laugh, though.\n\nHe could feel an abyss of shadow essence raging somewhere deep below him, the gigantic weave he had еtched into the mountain coming alive at his touch. The pulse he had sent spread through the intricate web of essence strings running through the vast network of tunnels Abundance had created, and then…\nThe entire mountain moved.\n\nSome distance away, on its southern slope, the Wolf had been given no time to reach the caldera. On the northern slope, the Snow Wolves were still disoriented by the sudden disappearance of their enemies. On the eastern slope, the unflappable brass giant was taking a step.\n\nThe ash covering the slopes of the volcano suddenly ignited with a soft glow, as if thе rock beneath it was shining. The soft glow rapidly turned into blinding, luminous radiance.\nThen, the ash was incinerated, dissolving into the searing light. Sunny belatedly remembered his own advice and glanced for something to take hold of.\n'Damn…'\n\nThe shadows rose to envelop the Shrine of Truth, and the platform it was resting on, into an impenetrable cocoon. The world turned white and absolutely silent.\nOutside, the entire volcano suddenly ignited with pure white light, shining brighter than the rising sun. The luminous white mountain was like a finger pointing at heaven, carved from peerless white jade - the golden radiance of dawn paled in comparison to its radiance, seeming dim and bleak.\n\nThen came the heat.\nThe ash was annihilated. Thе shattered rocks were annihilated, as well. The rivers of lava were turned into clouds of radiant plasma. The plasma… was turned into something else, something unknown.\nDivine flame, possibly. The primordial soup of creation, Creation was just the other side of destruction, though, if Nephis was to be believed. And Sunny was about to witness that destruction with his own two eyes…\n\nMetaphorically speaking, naturally, since he was on his knees in the darkness of the temple, with his eyes closed. There were no shadows left anywhere on the volcano, either, so he could not even sense the frightening majesty of the destruction he had unleashed.\nOutside the range of his senses, a wave of unfathomable heat was unleashed from the slopes of the volcano. The veil of ash above it ignited like a starlit sky, then dissolved into the blinding light. The glass bridges melted.\n\nThe sea of clouds around the mountain evaporated - luckily, he was not there to see what was hidden below. He did hear something, however…\n[You have slain an adversary.]\n[You have slain an adversary.]\n[You have slain…]\n\nThe enchantment was aimed at anything that touched the surface of the volcano, which meant that the Shrine itself, which stood on a hanging platform suspended above the main shaft, was the only safе spot. However, the scale of the unleashed power was far too great for it to remain unscathed.\nAs an annihilated heatwave radiated outward from the slopes of the volcano, making the atmosphere boil and causing the snow on the mountains dozens of kilometers away to melt, some of it reached the cocoon of shadows enveloping the Shrine, as well.\nThe shadows burned.\nBut that… was only the beginning.\n\nBecause the volcano was melting like a candle from its own heat. The damage dealt to it by the first activation of the grandiose enchantment was absorbed, as well. And then released as an obliterating shockwave.\n'D - damn!'\nThe towering volcano shuddered.\nAnd then, it exploded.\nIt simply ceased to exist - the part of it above the vanquished clouds, at least. Deep fractures covered its melting slopes, and in the next instance, the slopes disintegrated into a rapidly expanding mass of burning rock and boiling lava. The fiery debris rained down, some leaving scorch marks on the surrounding mountains. The chains that held up the Shrine had been melting, and now, they snapped.\nThe platform plummeted down.\nSunny had made himself as heavy as he could, but still, he was almost thrown into the air.\n[You have slain an adversary.]\nThe cocoon of shadows was pulverized by the tidal wave of sound that arrived in the wake of the harrowing explosion. Sunny was suddenly both blind and deaf, barely cognizant of where up and down were.\n\nBy the time the Shrine of Truth crashed into something solid, the soundwave reached the surrounding mountains, stripping them of the remaining snow and sending cracks running through their slopes.\nThere would have been a secondary eruption of heat, and a secondary explosion… but now that the entire upper part of the volcano was no more, the enchantment Sunny had woven into it was gone, too.\nThe Snow Wolves were dead. The Cursed Demon - the Wolf - was dead, too. It had already been wounded, and while it did survive the initial wave of heat, the following shockwave tore what little remained of its scorched body apart.\nA god died just like that, slain with the help of its own strength by the trap of a cunning hunter.\n\nThe Clockwork Giant, though… was still alive.\nBut he did not stay alive much longer.\nHis brass breastplate had melted in the heat, but then restored itself. The following explosion, though, sent him flying high into the sky.\nHe plummeted down like an luminous comet, seemingly impervious to all harm. Soon, however, his shining metal body reached a point where clouds would have been before.\nSomething monstrous moved far below, then, reaching up to grab him and pull him down.\nSoon enough, the sinister construct was no more.\n\nThe clouds slowly flowed from afar, repairing the vast rift in the torn sea. The melting glass bridges finally cooled, turning into peculiar and gorgeous sculptures.\n\nWhere the towering volcano had once stood, only a melted stump of it remained. White mist washed against the glowing rock, turning into steam.\nThe entirety of the broken volcano had turned into a giant bowl, filled to the brim with lava.\nAnd in the middle of the fiery lake, a lonely platform floated on the lava, supporting the weight of a scorched temple.\n\nInside, suffering from unbearable heat, Sunny slowly rose from the floor and glanced at one of the two altars with a dazed expression.\nThere, three jade figurines had appeared at some point, as if summoned by magic.\nHe smiled, causing the crust of baked blood covering one side of his face to crack.\nHis voice was hoarse and unsteady:\n\"I, I think… I think we won.\""

    "content": "2367 Lake of Lava\n\n\"Your wounds are quite severe...\"\n\nSunny was sprawled on the floor, his breathing labored. Kai had assumed his human form and was standing above him, a concerned expression on his face - his worry was appreciated, but entirely misplaced, since there was no real need to fret.\n\nThe wounds looked worse than they were. Surely, the sight of mangled flesh, with bone visible in the deeper tears, was disconcerting. And his soul was hurt, too. But Sunny was Supreme, after all - a bit of damage like that was not going to kill him. In fact, these wounds were going to heal rapidly.\n\nBut not rapidly enough to be healed completely before the next battle, which was unfortunate.\n\nThe Obsidian Wasps he had lost would not repair themselves in time, either. The spell he had woven went up in flames with the volcano.\n\nSunny let out a sigh.\n\nReally, he had suffered quite a loss in this battle.\n\n“Well, I did fight a Cursed Demon, you know.\"\n\nThe battle against the Wolf had been truly frightful. Now that it was behind him, Sunny could truly appreciate the fact that he had somehow managed to last this long against a fallen deity of that Class.\n\nKai himself was battered and exhausted, but most of all, he seemed bewildered.\n\n\"A Cursed Demon, yes. I still can't believe that you killed it so quickly.\"\n\nSunny let out a hoarse laugh, then winced and thought better of it.\n\n\"Quickly? It might have felt quick to you, but I had been wrestling that fiend for an eternity. It wasn't quick at all, far from it.\" Time itself had fallen victim to their battle, so measuring how long exactly he had been trading blows with the Wolf was a fool's errand.\n\nGroaning, he turned his head and glanced at the three jade figurines standing on the altar, as if wanting to make sure that the feral fiend was truly dead. Then, Sunny sighed again.\n\n\"You've done well yourself, though. How many Saints are there who can boast battling a Cursed Beast?\"\n\nKai smiled.\n\n\"Not too many, I hope.\"\n\nBy which he meant that he hoped that as few Saints as possible would find themself in a position to fight a Cursed Nightmare Creature, naturally, not that there would be few who could match his glory.\n\n‘That guy...'\n\nKai's gaze shifted back to Sunny's bloodied form. Kneeling beside him, the archer spoke firmly:\n\n\"Heаl.\"\n\nAnd, obeying his command, both Sunny's body and soul started to heal faster. It was not quite as effective as what an actual healer could do, especially not a Transcendеnt one, but still quite miraculous.\n\nSunny let out a weak laugh.\n\n“Wow. You are a real magician.\"\n\nThen, he closed his eyes.\n\n\"I'll... rest now, if you don't mind. I am a bit spent.\"\n\nAs Kai nodded tiredly, beads of sweat running down his soot - covered face, Sunny released his manifestation and turned around into a shadow. Since his soul was wounded as well, not just his physical form, the pain did not disappear - but at least he did not have to feel the damn heat anymore.\n\n‘Damnation. Why couldn't I have become the Snow Tyrant, instead?\"\n\nEnjoying the cool embrace of shadows, Sunny slowly collected his thoughts. The battle might have been over, but that did not mean that the Death Game was. He had to start preparing for the adversary's next move. First things first.\n\nNow that dawn had run its course and the sun was climbing the vast dome of the sky, Sunny allowed his shadow sense to spread across what remained of the volcano.\n\nThere wasn't much left, really - just an enormous stone bowl containing a lake of lava, and the Shrine of Truth floating in its middle. Sunny did not try to explore how deep the lake went, since that would mean catching a glimpse of what hid beneath the clouds. For now, it was enough for him to know what the next battlefield he would have to fight on looked like.\n\nHe was sufficiently certain that all three of the Snow abominations were dead, but it was a relief to confirm that no trace of them was left.\n\nSunny remained motionless for a while, coming to terms with the fact that he had, indeed, won.\n\nHe had slain the Wolf.\n\nThat primordial fiend was the most powerful adversary he had killed to date. The battle against the ancient fallen deity had without a doubt been dreadful and tremendously harrowing, and yet it... it had not been as desperate as Sunny expected it to be.\n\nBut that was simply because he was too used to utter desperation. In truth, the battle had ended the way it had because he entered it sufficiently prepared. He had understood the nature of the adversary and devised a strategy according to that knowledge, executing the plan splendidly.\n\nThe beast had died in the hunter's trap. And now, nо trace of the beast remained. Sunny groaned.\n\nActually, he would have preferred it if some trace of his enemies had remained. The wolves seemed more like wraiths than actual beasts, which meant that eating their meat would have probably not been an option anyway, but what troubled him more was that there were no soul shards left in the wake of the three Snow figures, either. They had probably drowned in lava, or possiblу had been outright destroyed with the Nightmare Creatures. Sunny had never witnessed soul shards being destroyed with their hosts before, but then again, he had never witnessed such a battle either.\n\nThe cataclysm summoned into existence by his sorcery had unleashed truly profane power, so, there was no point to be surprised.\n\nHe still felt despondent at the loss of four Sacred soul shards, though.\n\n‘How regretful.'\n\nSunny allowed himself to feel disappointed for a while, then pushed his thoughts in a more productive direction.\n\nIt was not like he had gained nothing from the battle, after all.\n\nThe first benefit was quite obvious - it was that he was still alive. Kai and Slayer were also in one piece, and even the shade of Abundance had not been destroyed completely, meaning that it would be able to participate in the next siege.\n\nThe second benefit was the three jade figurines standing on the altar of the Shrine of Truth. They were the very reason Sunny had driven his companions all the way to the Shrine, in the first place - by sacrificing them, they would be able to grow much stronger, and therefore much better suited to face the next battle, and every Death Game battle after that.\n\nAnd lastly, there was the third benefit as well.\n\nIt was what Sunny had learned from his battle against the Wolf.\n\nThat one... that one was an unexpected boon, and one he was most curious about."

    "title": "2368 Wrong Order.docx",
    "content": "2368 Wrong Order\n\nSunny had made the decision to channel the essence of a concept opposite to that of the Wolf in the spur of the moment. However, it had not been a baseless idea.\n\nRather, he had come up with that countermeasure after coming to understand his enemy deeply. Learning the very essence of his enemies was one of the things he did best, after all, having shadowed countless humans and Nightmare Creatures in his life.\n\nSunny had learned that skill while mastering the first step of Shadow Dance. In the beginning, it was all about glimpsing the secrets of his adversary's battle style, but just as Shadow Dance had outgrown the confines of merely being a combat technique, its purview had expanded greatly, as well. Sunny had long become capable of sensing the flow of essence through his enemies. But after fighting the Wolf, he realized that he was also capable of sensing the adversary's Will - not just its impact, but also its affinity. Understanding the nature of the Wolf was one part reasonable deduction and one part being able to sense what its ferocious spirit truly was.\n\n'This is...'\n\nIt was strange.\n\nSunny felt that he had stumbled ontо something profound. Channeling the concept of the Hunter had helped him survive the ferocious assault of the Cursed Demon - possibly it was the very reason he had managed to survive until the volcano absorbed enough damage to produce a powerful enough explosion. And he did not delude himself into thinking that just anyone could have been able to accomplish the same.\n\nThat last part was especially important. Nephis possessed a singularly powerful Will, but her Will was firm and indomitable. It was like a sword that refused to break and demanded that everything else break under its blade. Her uncompromising spirit strived to be absolute.\n\nSunny's own will, however, was subtle and insidious. Nephis described it as a weapon that only knew how to kill, and there was certainly truth to her words - but that slaying weapon was flexible and versatile, willing to assume any form it needed to kill the enemy. Just like shadows were inherently formless, and therefore willing to assume any form. That was the reason why Sunny was uniquely positioned to channel any foreign concept, which meant that it was something that only he could do, or at least do so effectively. That ability suited him perfectly.\n\nSo perfectly, in fact, that he wondered if he was meant to discover it. Not in the grand way of being fated or influenced into stumbling upon it, though, more so in the way of that ability being the next step on the path he had been walking all along.\n\nWas this the sixth step of Shadow Dance?\n\n'I think it is.'\n\nSunny felt that it was, and that was why he was so bewildered. After all, he had not mastered the fifth step yet.\n\n'How... novel!'\n\nThis was the first time his understanding of Shadow Dance had become greater than his actual mastery of it. Before, he had always stumbled in the darkness, seeking epiphanies and revelations. Usually, the act of fathoming the secret of the next step meant mastering it. But this time, things were different. The fourth step of Shadow Dance allowed him to assume the shapes of his enemies. The fifth step was supposed to allow him to shadow their powers and Attributes, as well, he had even discovered a way to master it by fusing with his Shadows and augmenting those of his Domain - humans and shades both. However, Sunny had never gone through the actual process of doing so.\n\nThat was because by the time he learned the secret of the Fifth Step, his fаte had already been lost, and his True Name was gone. Without the True Name to anchor his self, it was too dangerous to delve so deeply into the essence of other beings and assume their form. He could easily lose himself forever, forgetting how to return to his own form in body, mind, and soul.\n\nSo, the fifth step of Shadow Dance remained beyond his reach. It had remained unreachable for so long, it seemed, that both Sunny and his enemies had grown in power greatly. And now, hаving failed to master it, Sunny was already discovering the secrets of the step after that.\n\n'So...'\n\nWas what he had done in the battle against the Wolf dangerous?\n\nSunny felt bitterly reluctant to admit it, but he knew that it was. The absence of a True Name was once again holding him back. Everything had gone smoothly this time, but that was only because the concept Sunny had channeled was not inherently foreign to his own spirit - it was the concept of the Hunter, after all, and Sunny was himself a greatly accomplished hunter. But what if the concept he had to channel was completely alien to him? Would he be able to embody it? Sunny knew that he would, with enough practice. He knew how malleable everything about him was. But would he bе able to return from channeling a concept that was in conflict with his own spirit? Sunny was not sure about that.\n\nWhat about channeling a hundred concepts, each of them vastly different and in opposition to each other? Well, that sounded like a perfect way to fall into complete lunacy, and Sunny already had precious little sanity left. He was already afraid of losing himself, or at the very least his humanity, to the nature of being Supreme. Or becoming something he despised on the path to Apotheosis.\n\n'This feels awful. Damn!'\n\nSunny felt like he had found a shiny weapon, only to discover that he was incapable of picking it up. Like he was denied something he was owed. He stayed nestled in the shadows, hidden in the darkness of the Shrine of Truth, unseen and motionless. His wounded soul was once again being ravaged by the scathing feeling of regret.\n\nIf only he had chosen differently, if only he had not surrenderеd to his desperate wish, if only he had not betrayed his friends, and still possessed his True Name. But Sunny knew that these thoughts were meaningless. There was no way to turn back time, and even if he could, regret would have been eating him alive all the same, just for a different reason. For a far worse reason.\n\nNo matter how much he regretted what he did, it was better than regretting something that he had never dared to do.\n\nWhich was not to say, that he could not correct his mistake and be rid of all this regret altogether.\n\nAll he had to do was make a choice and get his fate back.\n\n'I've already killed a Cursed Demon, now killing a Cursed Terror did not seem so impossible anymore.'\n\nBut Sunny still had doubts.\n\nSometime later, he emerged from the shadows and rubbed his face, chasing the uninvited thoughts away. He had no time to ponder these difficult matters now, because there were numerous enemies he had to kill.\n'Right. On to the next point of the agenda...'\nHis gaze fell on the three jade figurines."

    "title": "2369 Fine Thread.docx",
    "content": "2369 Fine Thread\nOnce again, Sunny gave Kai and Slayer one jade Beast figure each, to be sacrificed to the Shrine of Truth. Everything happened as it had happened before - after being placed on the altar, the figures turned to ash and were absorbed by them. A second ring was added to the one already encircling their soul cores…\n\nWell, a soul core in the case of Kai. In the case of Slayer, though, Sunny was not entirely sure what to call the radiant ember at the heart of her unfathomably dark self. A shard of a core in a shadow of a soul, possibly.\n\nLooking at it, he remembered what Eurys had told him once. That his Shadows were not entirely complete… if there was a way to complete them, Sunny did not know what it was. Or if there was a need or a benefit to completing them.\nAll he knew was that Slayer had been complete before being slain by his blade, but now, she was a part of him - just like the rest of his Shadows.\n'Another mystery to solve… one day.'\n\nThe second ring of ash made Kai and Slayer much stronger. It also allowed Sunny to imbue them with far more of his Will - enough so that he would not worry about sending either of them into a battle with Great Nightmаre Creatures.\nAs for the Cursed Ones, well… Sunny himself was not too confident when facing those. With how much his companions were enhanced by his Will, however, they would at least be able to help him take the Cursed Ones down. Their arrows would not bounce off the flesh of those fallen gods without leaving a scratch.\n'That's something.'\n\nThat was quite a boon, actually. The shadows of the Wolf and its pack were resting in his soul now, as well - as long as Sunny could summon the shade of the Sacred Demon into existence, his small army was going to become tremendously more powerful.\nStill…\n\nHe studied the third jade figure - the Snow Demon figure - which was left laying on his palm.\nHe wanted to become stronger, as well. Five of the Snow Tyrant's abominations had already fallen by his hand, including three Cursed Ones… but instead of making him feel secure, the experience of those battles only made Sunny feel trepidation.\nThe battle against the Wolf had been a close one. He had triumphed in the end, and it was quite a spectacular victory. And yet, nobody knew better than Sunny how easily he could have lost his life instead.\nHow was he going to fight a Cursed Devil?\n\nThere was a qualitative jump in power between Monsters and Demons, because Demons were sapient. But there was just as significant of a jump betwеen Demons and Devils, because Devils wielded profane and distressing powers. What was he going to do when a fallen deity unleashed its powers against him?\nWhat if that deity was accompanied not by Beasts, but by Monsters? Or even creatures of a higher Class?\nSo… Sunny was not going to refuse more power.\n\nThat said, he also wanted to learn the truth.\nWhatever boost he could receive from sacrificing the Snow Demon figure to the Shrine of Truth was bound to be if not insignificant, then at least marginal. Kai and Slayer could borrow his Will with the help of ash, but what would Sunny borrow? At most, his strength would somewhat increase.\n\nKnowledge, on the other hand, was the origin of all power. It was none other than Weaver themself who had said it… so, learning a useful truth could actually give him far more power than sacrificing a figure would.\nOr not.\n'I've decided.'\n\nSunny sighed.\n\"I think I am going to toss this thing into the lava.\"\nKai, who had been drawing his bow to get used to his newfound strength, glanced at him briefly.\n\"Whatever you think is best.\"\nThen, he lowered the bow and looked at him properly. There was a peculiar expression on Kai's face - not quite a frown, but something similar to it.\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\"What?\"\nKai remained silent for a bit, then shook his head.\n\"No, nothing. It's just… that Demon. Did you see anything peculiar when fighting it?\"\nSunny blinked a few times.\n\"That Demon was an eldritch god, everything about it was peculiar. What do you mean exactly?\"\nKai hesitated a little, then shrugged.\n\"It's just… I think I saw something when I was fighting the brass giant. Helping that worm of yours fight him, I mean.\"\nHis expression soured a little at the mention of Abundance, prompting Sunny to grin.\n\"What is this I'm sensing? A bit of repulsion toward Abundance? Come on now, Kai, it is just a worm… a truly enormous, sacred worm. Actually, it is practically a wyrm. Dragons and wyrms are kin, so doesn't that sort of make the two of you siblings?\"\nKai shuddered.\n\"No worm is a sibling of mine, thank you very much! Please don't say such awful things, Sunny!\"\nSunny laughed.\n\"Well, alright. No need to be so offended. In any case, what was it that you saw? We both know how special your sight is, Kai, so don't make the mistake of underestimating it.\"\n\nSunny was higher in Rank than Kai and vastly more powerful, but that did not mean that he was superior to his friend in all regards. In terms of perception, for example, Kai was far ahead of him - or anyone else, really. So, Sunny was inclined to take whatever Kai had seen seriously.\nKai lingered for a while, frowning, then said finally:\n\"During the battle… a few times, I thought I saw something glistening in the air behind the giant. But every time I tried to take a closer look, there was nothing there. I would decide that I saw wrong, only to be distracted by that shine again later. Eventually…\"\nHe paused for a moment, then added:\n\"I thought that I noticed a silver thread extending from his back and disappearing into the distance. It was so thin and fine as to аlmost be non-existent, so even I could not see it clearly. Then, it was gone in the blink of an eye, so I can't be sure that I did not simply imagine the whole thing. The battle was quite hectic, after all.\"\nSunny remained silent for a while, looking at him.\n\"Didn't you say that there was something strange about all the Snow abominations? Could they have strange threads extending from their backs as well?\"\nSunny himself had not seen or sensed any threads. But if these strings were as infinitely thin as Kai had said, there would be no shadows left by them on the ground - and therefore, there would have been nothing for him to sense.\nIt sounded quite suspicious, though, summoning imagery of puppets being pulled by puppeteer's strings. The Snow Tyrant had to be controlling its figures somehow, so Sunny responded to that imagery strongly.\n\nKai shrugged.\n\"I don't know.\"\nSunny let out a sigh.\n\"Keep an eye out for these threads in the days to come, then. If you do notice another, let me know.\"\n\nWith that, he headed away and left the temple.\nWalking over to the edge of the platform, Sunny glanced across the lake of lava. The heat here was almost unbearable, so he did not loiter around and directly tossed the jade figure into the lake.\nAs it was swallowed by bubbling lava, he took a few steps back and sat down.\n'Let's see…'\nSunny concentrated on the questions he wanted answered the most, hoping that it would affect what truth he received this time.\nHow had the world ended? How had the gods died? What had Weaver…\nThen, suddenly, he was somewhere else."

    "content": "2370 A Cruel Fate\nThe mountains had collapsed, creating a vast valley. The green slopes had turned into a brown desert of crushed rock… and now, the desert turned into a red river.\n\nThe blood - red cloaks of the imperial soldiers were like a crimson tide as they marched forward, sunlight glistening on the tips of their spears.\n\nFar above the sea of marching warriors, a hawk was gliding on the gentle winds. It opened its beak and let out a cry, then moved its wings to fly away. It was just in time - a moment latеr, a golden arrow flashed past it, tearing the sky apart.\n\nThe hawk folded its wings and plummeted down, then spread them again to glide and escape the cold gaze of the unseen archer.\n\nIt flew away, across the rolling hills of olive trees and beautiful cities. Across the wine - colored sea with islands where vibrant flowers bloomed among white rocks. Across deep forests teeming with wildlife, where holy beasts rested in the shade of emerald canopies, deep quarries where precious marble was being mined, and tranquil shrines.\nAcross a peaceful realm that was about to be devoured by the jaws of War.\n\nEventually, the hawk reached a vast city that sprawled around a tall hill and landed in the courtyard of a humble manor, turning into a woman who wore a deer hide around her shoulders. Her olive skin was covered in sweat, and her breathing was labored, her face showing fatigue from having crossed such a great distance in such a short time.\n\"My lady!\"\nHandmaidens rushed to offer her water and fresh fruit, their eyes gleaming with awe and veneration.\nThe woman drank deeply from a beautifully painted amphora, then waved the young girls away. When she looked at them, her own eyes became full of sorrow for a brief moment.\nThen, she hid her sorrow away.\n\"No time for that. Where is the prince? I must see him.\"\nThe handmaidens looked at each other, prompting her to frown.\n\"What is it?\"\nThey looked in the direction of the hill, where an ancient temple stood, its white pillars weathered from the passage of time.\n\"It is the Oracle… you have been summoned. The prince, as well.\"\nThe woman sighed bitterly, then wiped the water off her lips.\n\"Now they are speaking, huh?\"\nShe closed her eyes for a few seconds, then straightened and looked at the young handmaidens one more time.\nThe girls giggled in embarrassment under her gaze, which made the woman's face harden. Turning away, she left without looking back.\n\nThe atmosphere in the temple was peculiar when she arrived. It stood empty most of the time, but now, there were people.\nShe recognized most of them.\nThere was a noble young man with calm and wise eyes. A boy with red hair - an unusual color in this land. A scholarly woman with a long black braid, her graceful beauty both subtle and bewitching.\nThere was also a tall warrior with broad shoulders, his towering height making the others seem puny. A slender man in elegant clothes who looked like a sculptor. A ship captain whose rough skin had turned bronze in the sun, his eyes the same color as the sea. A blind poet whose songs were renowned across the realm. A woman who was either a priestess or a courtesan, or possibly both…\nEach and every one of them, except the boy, was famous for one reason or another. Some of them were immensely powerful, while some were only slightly so, but all were outstanding.\n\nAll in all, it was a peculiar crowd of people.\n\nAs the woman wearing a deerskin around her shoulders arrived, there were now nine of them.\nShe looked at the gathering with a frown, but chose to say nothing.\nThe warrior spoke, instead, his booming voice echoing under the roof of the ancient temple:\n\"What news?\"\nThe woman responded curtly.\n\"It is as we expected. The imperials are already on the match.\"\nThe warrior clicked his tongue.\n\"Curses! I should be gathering citizens into an army, not wasting my time here.\"\nThe noble young man looked at him calmly.\n\"We were summoned.\"\nDespite the difference in their height, the tall man seemed taken aback. He lowered his head.\n\"I am sorry, my prince. I spoke out of turn.\"\n\nSoon, they were ushered into the inner sanctum of the temple. There, three figures sat behind a veil.\nA young girl, a mature woman, and an old hag…\nAll three of them were blind, but saw much more than anyone with sight could.\nThey were the Oracle.\nThe young man kneeled before them.\n\"I, Eurys, greet you. We have arrived to answer your call.\"\nThe three women smiled and responded, their three voices becoming one:\n\"Greetings, brother!\"\n\"Greetings, my son.\"\n\"Greetings, child.\"\nThe young man - Prince Eurys - took a deep breath.\n\"Our homeland is in grave peril, oh Oracle. And so, we beseech you… please, show us how to save our realm.\"\nThe young girl seеmed sad. The woman stayed motionless. The old hag laughed.\n\"Have you finally learned manners, naughty child?\"\nThe young man stayed silent for a few seconds, then repeated his words:\n\"We beseech you.\"\nThe young girl moved, as if wanting to cross the veil and touch him, but the woman held her back. She turned her head to face the kneeling prince, and then said calmly:\n\"I am sorry, my son. But that is not why we called you.\"\nThe eight people staying behind the prince paled, while the prince himself pursed his lips.\n\nThe three women continued, their voices fusing with each other.\n\"This land of ours…\"\n\"Cannot be saved.\"\n\"The tapestry of fate is vast, but it is also cruel.\"\n\"The empire won't be stopped.\"\n\"Our cities…\"\n\"Will burn.\"\n\"Our people will be enslaved.\"\n\"Our kingdom will fall, its very name forgotten.\"\n\"We cannot stop it.\"\n\"But…\"\nThere was a second of silence befоre the Oracle spoke again.\n\"We can avenge ourselves.\"\n\"The nine of you can.\"\n\"The nine of you will.\"\n\"The Empire of War…\"\n\"Must be destroyed.\"\nThe prince looked up at the Oracle, his eyes full of darkness.\n\nEventually, he looked down.\n\"My, oh my. How can nine people destroy an empire? It is protected by a god.\"\nThere were a few moments of silence, and then the little girl leaned forward.\nHer childish voice rеsounded in the silence of the ancient temple, echoing under its roof:\n\"Then you must kill the gods.\""

    "content": "2371 Nine Fates\nAs the echoes of the little girl's voice turned into silence, the nine of them fell into silence, as well. Her words had sounded like jesting… or at least they were supposed to. How could mortal men kill the gods?\n\nAnd yet, a solemn atmosphere settled in the inner sanctum of the Oracle temple. This peaceful realm of theirs was breathtaking and thriving, but it did not enjoy the protection of a god. The gods had grown aloof and distant long ago… their temples stood proudly, and yet no matter how piously the priests and priestesses prayed, they were usually met with indifferent аbsence. Even War, the patron deity of humanity, had withdrawn from watching over the great, awful empire of his.\n\nThe mortal realm where the nine of them had been born was not protected even by a neglectful deity, and so, it venerated no god. The ones they venerated instead were the Oraclе - the women capable of glimpsing Fate. The vast tapestry of fate was not something that mortals were meant to see, so the Oracle was blind, the awful visage of what they had witnessed burned into their eyes, destroying them forever. That was their curse, but also their solace. The Oracle was telling them that their rеalm was doomed, and that they would have to kill the gods.\n\nPrince Eurys finally spoke, his voice shaking subtly: \"Mother… oh, Oracle. But… how can nine mortals kill the gods?\"\nThe old hag seemed to study him with her blind eyes, then leaned back a little. Her creaky voice resounded in the inner sanctum: \"The War Empire is an insatiable beast that feeds on conquest. It is vast; it is prosperous. However, that prosperity is wicked, and worse than that, it is unsustainable. Their economy and their way of life can only be sustained by an influx of riches, or resources - and most importantly, of new slaves. Without the slaves, the Empire could not produce anything. But slaves… are not a renewable resource.\"\n\nThe woman spoke next, her words echoing somberly in the inner sanctum of the temple.\n\"You've read the imperial treaties, my son. You know the cruelty of their ways. The slaves they take do not last long, enduring endless labor. A few years, possibly… a decade, at most. And so, the Empire needs to conquer new lands, and procure new slaves. It won't ever stop, because it can't stop - if it does, it will starve.\"\nThe little girl spoke last, her voice turning small.\n\n\"Our kingdom is a peaceful one. It is a land of art, wine, wisdom, poetry, and culture. The Empire will come and take our art. It will take our wine. It will take our poets and philosophers and turn them into house slaves to educate the young masters. The rest - those who survive - will be sent to toil in the fields. In just a few generations, our culture will be no more. Our people will be us no more. Consumed and stolen by the conquering tyrants.\"\nThe woman wearing a deerskin around her shoulders finally spoke, her quiet voice sounding calm and even:\n\"That doesn't answer the question. All of us can't even stop an empire that one god watches over. How will the nine of us kill all six of them?\"\nThe Oracle grew silent.\n\nEventually, the old hag spoke solemnly: \"You are a huntress, are you not? You should know how to kill a beast that is stronger than you.\"\nThe woman spoke next.\n\"The answer is simple. Not that it will be easy, far from it. It will be difficult. It will be unbearable. It will be impossible, even, for each of you.\"\nThe little girl finished what the woman started saying:\n\"But you must achieve the impossible, each of you. You must find the beast's weakness. You must lure it into a trap. You must sink your blade into the weak spot that you found.\"\n\nThe three of thеm spoke in unison then…\n\"The nine of you were chosen because you are special, just like this realm of ours was. Some of you are wise, and some of you are strong. Some of you are holy. However, fate has no use for those who are strong or those who are wise, and neither does it care for sages and saints. The only ones it cares for…\"\nTheir voices enveloped the sanctum, sounding like a prophecy.\n\"Are those who are fated. And that is what you are, the nine of you. You are blessed by fate… you are cursed by fate. The strings of fate wrap around you tightly, and so, everything you do will echo across fate, shaking its very foundation.\"\n\nThe old hag opened its mouth to continue, but at that moment, the prince who was kneeling on the floor interrupted her: \"You say that our land will be ravaged by the empire, that our people will be slaughtered and enslaved. That we cannot save anyone, but must instead avenge everyone. That we must kill the gods?\" His voice shook with barely suppressed anger.\n\"But must we really abandon our people? And what will happen to the world when the gods die? Aloof as they are, the gods serve as the pillars of existence. All of it rests on their shoulders. Must we… destroy it all?\"\nInstead of the Oracle, it was one of the nine who answered - a tall warrior with broad shoulders, his face as pale as ash, his eyes brimming with sorrow and darkness:\n\"If everyone we know and love will not exist anymore… then what is the worth of that existence? You are young and noble, my prince. You have no wife, no lover, no children. You will not have to watch them die or be taken by War. There is only one thought more awful than knowing that our everything is doomed - the thought that those who bring us doom will remain unpunished. So, yes… if the Oracle speaks the truth, we shall destroy it all. We must. Why would we not?\"\n\nThe young prince gritted his teeth.\n\"Because we will be destroying our own people, as well! Those who'll survive the slaughter and be taken by the empire?\"\nHis words seemed to cool the inner sanctum. The faces of the nine people fell, and hints of doubt found their way into their eyes. They fell into a somber silence.\n\nAnd in that silence, the courtesan wearing the clothes of a priestess spoke quietly, her voice resounding with the darkest kind of resolve: \"It is better to be dead than to be a slave. It is better to be killed than to be shackled. I will welcome death before I welcome chains… those I loved will mourn me, but they'll know. When I die, I'll be free.\"\nDeath was merciful, after all, but the life of a slave was cruel.\nSlowly, the rest of them nodded their heads, and the prince lowered his.\nThe faces of the Oracles changed subtly.\nEventually, the old hag spoke:\n\"Each of you will have a task of their own. A great task… a terrible task. A task that must be accomplished at all costs. We are the Oracle, and we see fate. And so, we offer you as a sacrifice to fate. Go forth and drown the world in ichor as a retribution for the blood of our people that has not been spilled today, but will paint the sea red tomorrow.\"\n\nThe winds outside the temple howled as the woman turned to look at the bewitching scholar.\n\"Sorceress Aletheia, the Philosopher. Your task is to scout truth. Go forth and reveal the lies of the gods! You will find their weakness, and teach the others how to bring upon doom.\"\nThe little girl glanced at the slender man in elegant clothes.\n\"Aemedon the Sculptor, the Shaper of Stone. You will build the trap for the gods… you will herald the truth that Aletheia learns, and bring it to those who must listen. To form their hearts into gravestones, and build the walls of the trap from that stone.\"\n\nThe woman leaned forward, her features twisting with sorrow.\n\"Prince Eurys… my son. Forgive me. Your task is the most bitter of all…\"\nThe young prince was to become a slave.\nThe blind poet was to become lost in illusions…\nThe woman wearing a deerskin around her shoulders listened to what the Oracle ordered the others, her expression turning somber and pale. The task entrusted to the young boy, Auro, was especially distressing.\nShe shuddered when thе little girl spoke the terrible words. Eventually, though, the Oracle grew silent and dismissed the others.\nShe was the only one left.\n\nThe woman raised her chin faintly.\n\"What of me, then? What is the task that I must accomplish?\"\nDespite her questions, the oracle remained silent.\nAfter a while, the old hag let out a long sigh, so ancient and frail that it seemed like she would fall into pieces the next moment.\nHer voice sounded hoarse, tired, and scared.\n\"You… oh, courageous huntress. Your task is the gravest. Your task is the most important of them all, as well as the most fearsome.\"\nThe little girl continued:\n\"We the Oracle have witnessed fate. And using fate, we charted a course for the Nine. However… there is a being who knows fate far better than we do; who is far more adept at twisting its strings than we are. That being is your greatest adversary. And so, the task that you must accomplish is to strike that enemy down.\"\nThe third Oracle shivered, then leaned forward and said in a tone of ruthless resolve:\n\"Slay Weaver, the Demon of Fate. That is your fate, and what you must do.\""

    "content": "2372 Distant Gods\n\nSunny was startled awake - or rather, he regained his senses after receiving the truth. Just like the previous times, the boon he received was not quite a vision, but also not quite a memory. Rather, it was as if the knowledge of what had happened was placed directly into his mind, vague and disjointed, but somehow easy to understand.\n\nThe world of Ariel's Game was the same. The Shrine towered behind him, while the lake of lava was radiating insufferable heat in front of him. The sky was obscured by smoke and ash.\n\nHowever, Sunny was different from how he had been before throwing the jade figure into the lake. There was a stunned, disbelieving expression on his face, and his heart was beating wildly.\nHis eyes were open, but he did not seem entirely aware of his surroundings just yet, overwhelmed by what he had learned.\n\n\"No way…\"\nSunny jumped to his feet.\n\nHe was too rattled, his mind too full of chaotic thoughts, to calm down easily. He remained motionless for a while, then commenced pacing, kicking pieces of rubble with his feet.\n\"No, really. No way!\"\n\nFinally, Sunny stopped and looked at the distant mountains with wide eyes.\n\"What the hell did I just witness?\"\n\nThe magnitude of the revelation he had received as a reward for killing the Wolf was too vast to fathom. Gods, daemons, the fate of the world, Weaver…\nAnd the Nine.\n\nThe mysterious group of people whose faint traces he discovered from time to time. Sunny always suspected that the Nine had been important - to the degree that his glorious appraisal in the First Nightmare could have very well been mostly due to the fact that he had managed to kill Hero… Auro of the Nine.\nThe young boy with vibrant red hair who had appeared in two of the truths Sunny had learned in Ariel's Game.\nBut to think thаt the Nine had been responsible for the death of the gods.\n\n…Had been determined to kill the gods, at least.\nThere was no telling if they had succeeded.\nBut, somehow, Sunny was inclined to believe that they had.\n\nWhen he tossed these two jade figures into the lava, the question he had asked wаs about the end of the world. Instead of a scene of total devastation on a battlefield between the gods and the daemons, though, he had been shown a seemingly mundane event of mortal men arriving on a gorgeous island to inform a huntress who lived there that a Supreme Beast was rampaging on the border of their kingdom.\nSunny had assumed that he had been shown a moment of Slayer's past then and he had.\n\nBut what if that moment was also the answer to his question?\nWhat if that… was the moment the world's fate had been sealed?\nSunny grabbed his head and tried to calm himself.\n'So… let's… let's think about it slowly.'\n\nThere was an empire founded by War God… by one of War God's mortal vessels, most likely. At the dusk of the Golden Age, the gods grew aloof and distant, paying less and less attention to the mortal realms. And in their absence, the Empire of War embarked on an endless conquest.\nIt devoured myriad realms, subjugated myriad people, burned the temples of Shadow God… all for the glory of their neglectful deity.\n\nGlory, glory, glory,\nSunny had experienced the torment of being an imperial slave himself, during his First Nightmare. He experienced the savagery of the War zealots as well, in his Second - granted, those had been driven mad by Hope, their most ardent desires set aflame by her poisonous influence.\nThe Empire continued to grow, conquering more and more land until it encountered a particular realm. It was a beautiful and peaceful realm… but it was also a very special one.\nBecause the people of that peaceful realm venerated no god, and were ruled by an Oracle instead.\n\nIn the revelation Sunny received, the Oracle mentioned that their kingdom was special in passing. But he knew that it had to be true - not only because of the three seers themselves, but also because there had been nine people living in that realm who all possessed the [Fated] Attribute… just like he possessed it once.\n'That alone is mad! It's completely crazy!'\n\nThe Nine - all of them - had been Fated, just like Sunny was. Attributes were not unique to people, so there could be someonе out there sharing this one with him, even if [Fated] felt like something exceedingly, if not inconceivably, rare.\nSunny would have accepted that one of the Nine had been Fated, but all of them? Nine people, living in the same kingdom, and at the same time on top of that?\nThat… that sounded like their existence itself had been fated. As if it had been one of the knots holding up the great tapestry of fate together.\nThat small realm of theirs had indeed been special.\n\nAnd when the hungry gaze of the Empire fell upon it… the Oracle sent nine fated champions to destroy the Empirе. Not to save their homeland, which could not contend against War, but to avenge its destruction. To avenge their people, who were destined to be slaughtered and enslaved.\nThere was only one problem, though… the Empire had a guardian deity. One of the six great gods.\nAnd so, the Nine were sworn to kill the gods.\n\n'They… they couldn't have succeeded, could they?'\nOnly they could. The gods were dead, after all. The Empire had been destroyed. The sins it had committed brought upon a truly wrathful retribution - both on the Empire and on the rest of the world.\n\nSunny lowered his hands slowly.\n'Can… can it really be the reason?'\nCould the world have been destroyed by nine mere mortals and their dark resolve?\nIf it had been… then it would be quite poetic, if a little terrifying. It would make it so that the gods doomed themselves by neglecting the world they had created, and allowing those who claimed to wield their authority to rampage across the mortal realms.\nThe great gods would have been undone by little, insignificant mortals, whose suffering they had ignored. But how could the Nine have killed the gods? That was what Sunny did not understand.\nThe clues were already in his hands, though…'"

    "content": "2373 Walls of the Trap\n'The Nine, the Nine… what do I know about the Nine?'\n\nAuro had been an imperial soldier as a young man. Eurys had been an imperial slave, but he also claimed to have slit a god's throat… now that Sunny knew more, he could guess that it had been the mortal vessel of War God, most likely. The one watching over the Empire.\n\n'It had to be, right?'\n\nAletheia, meanwhile, ventured into the Tomb of Ariel.\nSunny's eyes widened.\n'Wait.'\nWhat was it that the Oracle had said?\n\"You simply have to find the beast's weakness. You have to lure it into a trap. You have to sink your blade into its weak spot.\"\nHe remained silent for a while.\n'Aletheia…'\nThe sorceress and philosopher, Aletheia, had been tasked with revealing the lies of the gods and teaching the truth to the rest of the Nine.\nSo, she had gone to the Tomb of Ariel and became the First Seeker. She was the only Seeker of Truth to have successfully entered the Estuary, and learned the secrets hidden there by Ariel, the Demon of Dread.\n\nAnd among those secrets… was the truth of the Forgotten God and his children. Who were the Flaw of the gods.\n'Wait…'\n\nAletheia had paid for learning the secrets of the Estuary by becoming the source of the Defilement. But that did not mean that she had failed to teach the truth of the Forgotten God to the rest of the Nine before succumbing to Corruption. She must have endured the knowledge of the Void and only passed that one secret along, considering that they seem to have succeeded in their plot at least partially.\nBut wasn't it peculiar?\n\nThe gods were indeed dead, but they had fallen in the war against the daemons… not against the Nine. The great war that had brought doom upon all of existence. So what had the Nine really achieved?\n\nSunny took a step back, biting his lips.\n'Wait!'\nThe sculptor, Aemedon… what was the task the Oracle had given him?\n\"You will build the trap for the gods… you will herald the truth that Aletheia learns, and bring it to those who must listen. To form their hearts into gravestones, and build the walls of the trap from that stone.\"\n\nThis, this was the answer!\nAletheia had learned the weakness of the beast, but it was Aemedon who had been tasked with building the trap. It was a trap meant to bring about the death of the gods, though, so it would be peculiar to assume that the Oracle meant a literal contraption. Instead… it was a trap built from the hearts of living beings.\nAnd who could it have been whose heart was supposed to become a gravestone for the gods?\n\"Bring it to those who must listen…\"\nTo whom was Aemedon meant to deliver the truth Aletheia learned? Who had to listen?\nSunny's eyes glistened darkly.\n\nWhy, it was quite obvious, wasn't it? Considering what had happened next.\nIt was Nether, the Prince of the Underworld. The Demon of Destiny, the Demon of Choice. He suddenly clenched his fists and shook them in the air.\n\"You damn Spell!\"\n\nThe description of the Mantle of the Underworld clearly said this about Nether:\n[,He wasn't the first to lead his army against the gods. However, he was the first to shed their blood, as well as learn the secrets of his own.]\n\nBut it was a blatant lie! Well… perhaps it wasn't. But it was entirely misleading.\n\nThere were runes written by Nether on the walls of the Ebony Tower, which had been constructed after Hope was imprisoned by the gods. He had been wondering if the daemons were forbidden from siring offspring because they were of the Forgotten One, who slumbered in the Void.\nThat indicated that he had known about the connection between the seven daemons and the Forgotten God. However, he must not have known the whole truth. Otherwise, he would not have been asking the question.\n\nWeaver knew… probably because Weaver had ventured into the Void and beheld the Forgotten God in person. Ariel knew, as well, because he knew everyone's fears - including that of the gods. But he chose to bury that knowledge in the Tomb, Where Aletheia found it.\nAnd then…\nAemedon delivered that truth to the Underworld, and gave it to Nether.\nAnd Nether made his choice.\n'Hell.'\nThat… that was the inception of the Doom War.\n\nAemedon of the Nine had indeed built a trap for the gods. The walls of thе trap were the hearts of the daemons, and he was the one who had shown them the way.\nSunny let out a laugh of disbelief.\n\"How do you kill а beast that is stronger than you?\"\nYou cоuld, for example, sick another harrowing beast upon it.\n\nThe Nine were not powerful enough to kill the gods, so they gave Nether the last push he needed to rally his siblings into rebelling against the heavens. That was how the world had ended.\nOr rather, that was how its end had begun.\n\n…Naturally, the Nine did more than just give the world the initial push to send it rolling into the abyss. After all, Sunny had only considered the horrible and, quite honestly, unbelievable feats of two. There were seven of them left.\nThe blind poet… had probably gone to the Demon of Imagination. The seasoned sea captain, the vision had not revealed his task, but Sunny could easily imagine him having something to do with the Demon of Repose and Night Garden.\n\nEuris had been a spy in the heart of the Empire, most likely, eventually ending up in the Demon Army. Auro… his task had apparently been the most distressing of them all, even if Sunny had no idea what it was. There was also the courtesan and the tall warrior. They were quite mysterious, and he was not sure what their role had been.\nAnd Slayer, naturally…\nThat one, he was not ready to contemplate yet.\nBut what had they done? What had their endgame been?\nSunny took a deep breath.\n\n'Find a weakness. Build a trap. Sink your blade into the weak spot of the adversary.'\n\nThe weakness of the gods was the existence of the Forgotten God, and therefore the daemons. The trap itself was the Doom War.\nBut what was the blade of the Nine? How had intended to deliver the lethal strike to the gods? Had they simply supported the daemons in the Doom War, or had there been more to their machinations?\nSunny exhaled slowly.\nThen, a different set of runes surfaced in his memory…\nHis eyes shook."

    "content": "2374 Demon of Doom\nThey were the runes left on the floor of the underground cell under the ruined cathedral of the Dark City by one of the two High Priests of thе Nigthmare Spell, from whose corpse Sunny had retrieved Weaver's Mask. He had not been able to read them at first, but managed to discern their meaning during his return to the Forgotten Shore as a Saint.\n\nTaking a step back, Sunny whispered:\n\"Thus spoke Weaver… they will open the Gates. And they did, calling forth doom and destruction upon us. Now, in the ruins, gods lay dead. And the daemons have fallen. The Forgotten One comes, wide awake, to consume them.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes for a moment.\nThe weapon to kill the gods… was it the Forgotten God himself? Had the Nine wanted to unseal the Void, thus awakening him and causing the end of all existence?\nWas that their vengeance for the blood of their people that the Empire had spilled, for the land it destroyed, and the freedom it robbed?\nWere these bastards fated, or were they a personification of doom?\n\"Those… those lunatics.\"\n\nHe shuddered, then shook his head.\n'No… no, I am jumping to conclusions.'\nWeaver had proclaimed that \"they\" would open the Gates. The they in question could have been the Nine… it could have been the daemons. Or the gods. It could have even been Weaver themselves - the Demon of Fate could have been simply proclaiming their own intention.\nSunny raised his hands and rubbed his face fiercely.\n\nHe had learned so much… but he still did not have any answers!\nHow had that damned war ended?\nHad the Nine achieved their goal, or had they ultimately failed?\nWere the Gates of the Void open, or were they still closed?\nThe spreading Corruption, the blossoming Nightmare Seeds, and the constant expansion of the Dream Realm suggestеd that they were wide open, and that the Forgotten God was free. And yet, the Forgotten God also seemed imprisoned and asleep, because if he was not, there would be no existence left. All of it would be swallowed by the Void.\nEverything was a paradox, and Sunny did not have the key to solve it.\n'Ah, I don't get it…'\nHe groaned.\n\nOne thing was certain, though.\nThere had always been a third player hiding behind the curtain. The daemons, the gods… and the Nine.\nThe fate of the world had been decided by these three forces.\nAnd while the Nine seemed pitifully weak in comparison to these mythical figures, their influence was anything but. In fact, because of how little was known about them, the Nine seemed especially dangerous.\nNo… actually, there was a fourth force as well. The most important of them all. How could Sunny have forgotten?\nThere was Weaver.\n\nSunny exhaled slowly.\nHe still did not know how Weaver fit into all of this, what goal Weaver had pursued, and what had happened to them.\nThe Oracle had seemed to believe that the Demon of Fаte would be the greatest obstacle in the path of the Nine. Considering that the Nine had intended to kill the gods and destroy the world… did that mean that Weaver's goal had been the opposite?\nNo, it did not. Knowing that slippery daemon… not that Sunny knew them that well… it could have been anything. Weaver might have been the enemy of the Nine, or they might have been using the Nine to further their own goals.\nWho could know the truth?\nWell… Slayer could, if she had her memories.\nAfter all, her task was to kill Weaver.\n'Insanity!'\n\"To hell with this.\"\n\nTurning around, Sunny headed for the Shrine of Truth with determined steps. Entering the cool darkness of its great hall, he ignored Kai and walked directly to Slayer, who was sharpening her swords while leaning her back against one of the altars.\nStopping in front of her, he looked down and growled:\n\"So… tell me. Did you manage to kill Weaver?\"\nThe sinister Shadow stared at him silently, showing no trace of emotion.\nHe scoffed.\n\"Or did you fail? Right. You must have.\"\nNaturally, she had. How could someone so insignificant slay the Demon of Fate? The very thought was preposterous.\nBut then again…\nThe thought that nine mortals could bring about the death of the gods was preposterous, as well. And yet, the gods were dead.\nWas the woman whose Shadow now served him truly Weaver's killer?\nNo, it was impossible.\n\"You must have died by Weaver's hand, instead!\"\nSlayer showed no reaction at all, as if his words held no meaning.\nHowever…\nHe felt her cold, blacк eyes changing faintly.\nFinally, there was a hint of emotion.\nWhat was it?\nPride… despair? Resolve? Confusion?\nIt seemed that Slayer did not know herself.\nWell, why would she?\nShe did not even remember her name, let alone her past.\n\nSunny covered his face with a palm and sighed deeply.\n\"What, what the hell did you do, you lunatics?\"\nSlayer stared at him for a few more seconds, then shrugged and returned to sharpening her swords, completely indifferent to the turmoil in his heart.\n\nSunny cursed quietly.\n\"I… have some strong words to say to Eurys, the next time I meet him.\"\n\nKai, who had walked over and was looking at them in confusion, raised a brow.\n\"Eurys? Who is that?\"\nSunny looked at him, blinked a few times, and waved a hand in a dismissive gesture.\n\"Eurys… he's just an acquaintance of mine. A god - slaying slave, but also a prince, who was banished from death by a divine curse. He just sort of hangs out in the Shadow Realm now, so I visit him from time to time to chat, joke around, and try to kill him. Oh… he's also a skeleton. A talking skeleton. Well, about eighty percent of a talking skeleton - he had lost a few bones over time.\"\n\nKai nodded slowly.\n\"Ah, I see. Makes sense, I guess. Are you alright, though? You seem… on edge.\"\nSunny glanced at him darkly.\n\"Naturally I am alright.\"\nHe smiled and pointed at himself with a thumb.\n\"I am perfectly alright being on edge.\"\nKai coughed.\n\"Oh. That's… good, then.\"\n\nNext morning, three new Snow figures arrived to surround the destroyed volcano."

    "title": "2375 Hear no Evil.docx",
    "content": "2375 Hear no Evil\n\nThe abominations of the Snow Domain surrounded the Shrine of Truth in the morning. This time, it was a Cursed Demon and two Cursed Monsters - the force that had been defending the Shrine of Fear at the start of the game.\n\nBy then, the lake of lava was already starting to cool. It slowly lost its radiance and dimmed, solidifying into a vast plain of ash-grey rock. However, Sunny knew that the solid nature of this crust was merely an illusion - it was like a thin layer resting atop a scorching abyss of magma, too easily broken by the forces that a battle between deific figures would unleash. Actually, he was considering using the treacherous nature of the thin crust as a strategy. Cursed Nightmare Creatures would not be seriously harmed by something as trifling as taking a plunge into a pool of lava, and they were not going to drown in it, either. However, he could still gain an advantage by pulling them into the depths of the volcano…\n\nJust not too deep, since he was wary of descending lower than the sea of clouds.\n\nCursed Nightmare Creatures were not as bound by the mundane logic as lesser beings were, but some things were still dictated by their nature. For example, creatures that were meant to walk the earth would grow weaker if forced to fight in the water. Sunny himself, however, did not have that problem - he could change his form freely, and so, any battlefield was his home.\n\nThe form of the Onyx Serpent was one he was attuned to the most, as well. Or rather, would it be the Jade Serpent now? In any case, he had battled Daeron the Serpent King while using this Shell, and countless abominations since. So, if he managed to pull the new Snow Demon into the lava…\n\nThere, in the depths, he might actually defeat it.\n\nBut Sunny did not feel confident.\n\nIn fact, he was overcome by a feeling of unease. He felt like a rat that had been pushed into a corner.\n\nThe battle against the Wolf had already been dangerous enough. It had been a close call. Now, however…\n\nSunny's wounds, both physical and unseen, were quite severe. They had healed somewhat, but not enough to allow him to enter the battle at his full strength come tomorrow. So facing a Cursed Demon, even in the depths of the volcano, did not seem like a winning bet.\n\nFar from it.\n\nIf Sunny was honest with himself, he had to admit that he would not be of much use as a warrior in the upcoming battle.\n\nLuckily, there was a different strategy he could use… had to use, considering that there were no better options.\n\nInstead of participating in the battle himself, he could turn into a shadow and enhance someone.\n\nKai аnd Slayer both received two boons of ash. They were already far more powerful than Transcendent beings were supposed to be, and while Sunny could not enhance Kai - his friend was neither part of him nor a subject of his Domain - he could amplify Slayer.\n\nThat was not an optimal use of his power, though.\n\nThe optimal use of it would be to amplify one of his most powerful shades. The shade of the Wolf, for example.\n\nThe shadows dwelling in his soul were not alive and did not possess the sense of self. As a result, they could not really wield the Will, which was of paramount importance in a battle between deities. So even the Sacred shades were not too different from immensely powerful, but ultimately mundane beasts.\n\nThat was unless Sunny wrapped himself around them.\n\nIf he did, not only would their power be amplified, but he would also be able to substitute their absent Will with his own. That way, a Sacred shade would become much closer to the glory of its former self.\n\nIf Sunny enabled the shadow of the Wolf, the two of them together would stand a decently goоd chance of slaying a Cursed Demon.\n\nThat was something to consider, at least. That was the best strategy he could come up with in the absence of Sacred soul shards to cast some powerful spell, or any other material and resource to pull off a daring trick.\n\n'It… should be good enough, right?'\n\nIf Sunny and the Wolf faced the Cursed Demon… Slayer, Kai, the shadow of Abundance, the pack of Shadow Wolves, and the remaining Obsidian Wasps would have to deal with the two Cursed Monsters.\n\nCould they?\n\nAlternatively, he could take a risk and concentrate all his forces on one of the enemies first, gambling on the chance of slaying it speedily.\n\nThere was a lot to consider.\n\nBut he could only consider it after learning more about his enemies.\n\nAt that moment, Sunny and his companions were standing on the roof of the Shrine of Truth, observing the surrounding peaks tensely. The sun was rising above the miniature realm of Ariel's Game, and the glass bridges were collapsing into plumes of snow.\n\nSunny sighed and glanced at Kai.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\nKai nodded.\n\n\"Quite sure, yes. It should be a Demon.\"\n\nKai could see further and better than Sunny, but he could not see the souls of living beings like Sunny. That said, Awakened possessed senses beyond that of mundane people, and these senses developed the more experienced they became, and the higher their Rank was. Saints would rarely be mistaken about the Class and Rank of an adversary even without gazing into the adversary's soul.\n\nSunny remained silent for a few seconds, then asked somberly:\n\n\"So what kind of loathsome horror is it?\"\n\nKai raised a hand to shield his eyes from the rays of the rising sun and looked east, at the distant snow-covered peak.\n\nHis expression changed subtly.\n\n\"I see it. It…\"\n\nHis voice changed, too.\n\n\"…it is looking back.\"\n\nThen, Kai fell silent, his body trembling faintly.\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"What does it look like, though?\"\n\nKai's lips moved as if he was going to say something… before he did, however, Sunny was distracted by a sudden movement.\n\nHe glanced to the side in confusion, where Slayer seemed to be unsheathing her swords.\n\n'Odd.'\n\nKai finally spoke, the words leaving his mouth sounding like a jumbled mess of eerie, alien curses.\n\nSunny belatedly realized that listening to these words was a dreadful mistake… but by then, they had already crawled into his ears, and slithered their way into his mind.\n\n'Not good.'\n\nThen, everything turned dark."

    "title": "2376 Missing Time.docx",
    "content": "2376 Missing Time\n\n'I'm hurt…'\n\nThe first thing Sunny felt was pain. He was supposed to be in pain, considering that both his body and soul had been ravaged by the Wolf. But the mild suffering he had been enduring without even paying attention to was gone, replaced by a new and unfamiliar agony.\n\nHis entire body was in pain.\n\nThe pain was not concentrated in one spot, but instead emanated from a dozen different sources, fusing into one odious sensation. Therefore, Sunny had to conclude that he was seriously hurt.\n\n',Since it hurts, I'm still alive.'\n\nThat was good news, at least. He opened his eyes slowly.\n\nThe black sky hung above him at an angle, awfully close. It was also made of scorched stone, with deep cracks running through its broken surface. Additionally, it was moving.\n\nNo… it was not the sky. He was staring at the ceiling of the Shrine of Truth. Or was it a wall? In any case, neither the ceiling nor the wall of the Shrine were moving. Instead, it was Sunny himself. He was being dragged across an uneven stone surface, its ridges biting into his back.\n\n'What, the hell?'\n\nThe last thing he remembered was asking Kai to describe the Snow Demon. How did he end up back in the Shrine?\n\nMore importantly, why was he being dragged, and who was dragging him? Craning his neck, Sunny looked up.\n\nSomeone was holding his wrist in a vice-like grip, using it to drag his body across the stone like a sack of synthpaste. That someone was shrouded in a veil of ghostly smoke, which made discerning their form difficult. Sunny recognized them instantly, naturally. It was Slayer… however, Slayer looked much worse than she had before. Her light armour was torn and scorched, dark smoke was seeping from myriad ghastly wounds on her ebony body, and one of her arms was hanging limp, seemingly broken.\n\n'What happened to Slayer?'\n\nNo, more importantly… What happened to him?\n\nSunny finally regained his senses and evaluated the situation. What he sensed sent him into utter shock.\n\nFirst of all… the ceiling above him was indeed the wall of the Shrine of Truth. And it was indeed looming above him at an angle - that was because the entire Shrine was tilted, half of its vast interior drowned by lava. Slayer was currently dragging Sunny up the slope of one of the pillars, away from the radiant lava.\n\nSecondly, there were several arrows sticking out of his body. The body itself was in even worse form than Slayer's, riddled with torn wounds and lacerations - new ones on top of the old ones. And most shocking of all, his entire right arm was missing.\n\n',Where did my arm go?'\n\nWhere was his arm? Sunny was so shocked that he remained motionless, allowing Slayer to drag him to where the pillar met the ceiling. Letting go of his wrist, she straightened and observed the interior of the Shrine darkly.\n\nEverything was too odd. Sunny simply could not understand what had happened, and what the situation was.\n\nHe let out a pained groan and sat up, then evaluated his condition somberly.\n\nHis wounds were quite severe, and his arm was indeed missing. Luckily, Blood Weave had prevented him from bleeding out, so his life was not at risk. His essence was nearly depleted, though, and his soul seemed to have sustained dire damage, as well.\n\nHis head ached horribly. Sunny had no words to describe his feelings.\n\n'Something really bizarre must have happened.'\n\nManifesting a bit of shadows to create a replacement for his missing arm and hand, he grimaced and pulled one of the arrows out from between his ribs. He stared at it, then glanced up at Slаyer.\n\n\"Mind telling me why one of your arrows was sticking out of me?\"\n\nNaturally, he would not have failed to recognize an arrow of his own exquisite making. She regarded him silently for a while, then raised a hand and extended four fingers.\n\nSunny frownеd.\n\n\"Four? What is that supposed to mean?\"\n\nThen, he glanced down and sighed.\n\n\"Oh. You meant that there were four of your arrows sticking out of me, not one… duly noted.\"\n\nGrimacing from pain, he pulled the rest of the arrows out, hesitated a little, and handed them back to Slayer. Instantly, his body felt a hundred times lighter.\n\n'That… that knave! She used my own enchantments against me!'\n\nIndeed, the four arrows in question were meant to immobilize the adversary, or at least slow them down. So, Sunny could at least surmise that his Shadow had not tried to kill him. She had merely tried to debilitate him.\n\nHe glanced at his missing arm. The stump was not bleeding, and the wound was messy. Not at all a clean cut… so, something else must have torn his limb off.\n\nThat was a relief.\n\n'How is this a relief? One of my limbs is missing!'\n\nSunny groaned. Still, he would have been quite cross if it turned out that Slayer had cut off his arm. It was better to think that something else had rended it off.\n\nThere was a hole in the wall of the Shrine where there had been none before, and through it, he could see the dark sky.\n\nIt was night.\n\n',It had been morning just a few moments ago.'\n\nSunny concentrated on his shadow sense, then turned his head and glanced at the nearby pillar. Kai was hanging from it, impaled by two black arrows, his mouth covered by a makeshift gag. He was alive, but unconscious. Sunny studied his friend for a bit, making sure that he was alright, then turned to Slayer once more.\n\nWhen he finally spoke, his voice sounded a little strained:\n\n\"So… do you want to tell me what happened to the day that is missing from my memory?\"\n\nSlayer stared at him chillingly for a while, then raised a hand and extended two fingers.\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n\"What do you… wait. Two days that are missing from my memory?\"\n\nShe nodded silently and sat down, tiredly leaning her back against the wall.\n\nSunny paled.\n\n'Two days…'\n\nIf two days had passed, then the Snow Demon and the two Snow Monsters had already launched their attack.\n\nThe battle was over?"

    "content": "2377 Oblivious Victors\n\nTwo days had passed, and it was night again. Which meant that the three figures of the Snow Domain had besieged the Shrine of Truth… and failed.\n\nSomeone had stopped them. But who?\n\nSunny studied his own pathetic state, then glanced at Slayer. Finally, he glanced at Kai.\n\nA few seconds later, he muttered a stifled curse. His thoughts were in disarray.\n\n\"What… the hell?\"\n\nHe had been saying that a lot after entering Ariel's Game. So, he had to be careful not to say it again… unless he wanted to get stuck with another catchphrase. And he had plenty of those already.\n\nIn any case, it seemed like Sunny and Kai had fallen victim to some kind of mind attack while observing the Snow Demon, and then… and then.\n\nSomething happened, but the Snow Demon failed to conquer the Shrine and kill them.\n\nFrom what Sunny had seen so far, that something seemed to have been Slayer. That did not make much sense, considering that Slayer was not nearly powerful enough to defeat a Cursed Demon, let alone one accompanied by two Cursed Monsters. And yet, the evidence was hard to deny.\n\nThe evidence being that they were still alive. Sunny sighed deeply.\n\nSlayer was not going to talk, so he had no choice but to try to deduce what had happened slowly. But first…\n\n'I should probably take Kai off that wall.'\n\nHis friend did not look very comfortable, pinned to a pillar by arrows and gagged. Granted, Slayer must have gagged him for a reason…\n\n',I'll take it slow.'\n\n***\n\nSome time later, Sunny and Kai climbed out of the tilting Shrine and observed the scene of utter devastation outside. Both looked rattled and confused, not to mention battered, and seeing the lake of lava did not make them feel any better. Slayer had stayed inside, seemingly too tired and wounded to move.\n\n\"What the…\"\n\nSunny stopped himself from finishing the sentence, raised his hands, and rubbed his face ferociously.\n\nOne of his hands was made of flesh, sinew, and bone. The other was entirely black, manifested from shadows.\n\nThe platform on which the Shrine of Truth stood had split in two. One half of it was entirely gone, the other was partially submerged in lava - the ancient temple itself was tilted on the side, half-drowned in the lake.\n\nThe layer of cooled lava that had formed a crust atop the lake was almost entirely gone, shattered and swallowed by the scorching crucible. Still, some of it remained… hideous silhouettes formed from volcanic rock protruded from the luminous depths, reaching toward the sky with eerily shaped fingers. They glanced like unfinished creations of a mad sculptor, and simply looking at them made Sunny's skin crawl.\n\nIt was as if a swarm of indescribable… beings… had tried to form themselves from fiery lava, but were frozen solid midway, failing to take form. Now, only their empty husks remained, soulless and twisted in agony, like a legion of sinful souls who had failed to escape hell. Or perhaps someone had just wanted to create a garden of creepy statues. Either version could be true.\n\nKai opened his mouth and whispered: \"What the hell?\"\n\nSunny glanced at him with gratitude. \",My thoughts exactly.\"\n\nHis friend was in rough form, but far better off than Sunny and Slayer. Apart from the wounds causеd by the arrows, he was relatively unscathed - and those weren't a threat to a Transcendent being.\n\nHe had no memory of what had happened in the past two days, either. The last thing he remembered was catching a glimpse of the Snow Demon… and yet, he did not remember what the creature looked like, or what it was.\n\nSunny felt deeply… unnerved. He would have been frightened, really, if not for the fact that they had found three jade figurines laying in the ash near the altar, just a few meters away from the lava.\n\nThe Snow Demon… whatever that thing had been… was dead. The Monsters were dead, too.\n\nSunny, Kai, and Slayer wеre alive. Somehow.\n\nThat should have been good news, but Sunny only felt more disturbed, not knowing how their enemies had died. Humans feared the unknown the most, after all.\n\nHe looked down with a grimace. \"Well, let us see what we do know.\"\n\nEven if his memory of the past two days was gone, he could deduce some things from the clues left behind by the missing time.\n\nAs the two of them flew to the edges of the volcano, the night sky rippling with shimmering starlight above them, Sunny went over all these clues.\n\nFirst of all, Sunny and Kai were missing their memories. They had been affected by some kind of mental attack, while Slayer had seemingly resisted it - or had been incapable of being targeted by that attack, to begin with, due to her inherent difference from them.\n\nIt was easy to deduce that Sunny and Kai had not remained passive and motionless while under foreign influence, too. In fact, they seemed to have involved themselves in all kinds of activity - their wounds were solid proof of that.\n\nAdditionally, their behavior in the past two days had to have been different from what they would usually do. In other words, they had not been acting as themselves - otherwise, Slayer would have no reason to debilitate them with arrows or gag Kai.\n\nSunny could not be sure, but after studying Kai's wounds - as well as his own - he suspected that the two of them had not only fought Slayer, but also other powerful beings… as well as each other.\n\nThat was quite a disturbing theory, and although Sunny could not thoroughly prove it, he could not confidently refute it either.\n\n'This is the worst.'\n\nIf they had indeed suffered a mental attack, this would be the worst crisis of that nature he had encountered in a long while, maybe even ever. After all, he had retained at least some senses even at LO49 or on the Ashen Barrow… but now, he could not even remember what he had done.\n\nThat should not have been possible. His mental resistances were extremely formidable, and even if his other incarnations were not here, he still possessed the Will of a Supreme Titan. No mental attack should have been able to enthrall him so thoroughly.\n\nIt was the fact that something that should have been impossible had happened that was driving Sunny mad. Just what kind of creature had that Cursed Demon been?\n\nThe worst part of all…\n\nWas knowing that now with the creature gone, there was a high possibility that Sunny would never find out.\n\nIt could all remain a mystery, forever. Looking around, he wondered if that was a mercy, instead."

    "title": "2378 Eerie Clues.docx",
    "content": "2378 Eerie Clues\n\nThe only witness - Slayer - was not talking, but Sunny had some other clues, as well. His own state, for example.\n\nQuite a lot of his essence was gone. Not only that, but he could not summon any of his shades, which meant that they all had been destroyed in the battle and were currently repairing themselves.\n\nThe Shadow Wolf and its pack, the Obsidian Wasps, and Abundance. 'Had I actually implemented the shade augmentation strategy?' It was possible.\n\nBut had he implemented it against the adversary… or against one of his companions? There was no answer to that, although Sunny doubted that either Slayer or Kai could have survived his assault.\n\nThe three Snow figures were dead, and he was missing an arm. So… unless it was Kai who had bitten it off in his dragon form, Sunny was inclined to believe that he had clashed with the Cursed Demon and the two Monsters, instead.\n\nHe glanced at Kai peculiarly. Kai noticed it and forced out a smile. \"What?\"\n\nSunny lingered for a while, then shook his head. \"Nothing. Just wondering how sharp your teeth are?\"\n\nKai touched his lips, then blinked a couple of times and looked away.\n\nThe problem was that the shades of the three Snow abominations were not in Sunny's soul. Which meant that, although they were dead, he had not killed them - and neither had Slayer. So how the hell had they died?\n\nSunny folded the wings he had manifested and landed on a rock outcropping at the edges of the lake of lava - too close to the misty shore of the sea of clouds to feel comfortable. Kai landed nearby, and the two of them stared at the enormous corpse in front of them.\n\nOr rather, a half of it. The Cursed Monster was unmistakably dead. It was an indescribable monstrosity that was vaguely humanoid in form, with myriad eyes littering the malformed dome of its grotesque head. It had a gaunt, pale torso and too many arms, each ending in a set of traumatic claws… as for the lower part of his body, there was no saying how it looked. It was missing. Sunny could swear that the detestable face of the fallen deity had frozen in a grimace of horror.\n\nHe glanced at Kai and shivered. \"Any idea how it died?\"\n\nKai remained silent for a moment, then said stiffly: \"Well, I am pretty sure that it died from being torn in half.\" That was pretty indisputable logic.\n\n…Well, actually, it wasn't. A Cursed Monster would not have been killed by something as mundane as being torn in half. Neither would it have been terrified in its last seconds.\n\nFeeling a cold shiver run down his spine, Sunny forced out a pale smile. \"Are there soul shards inside?\"\n\nKai nodded slowly. \"I see one. But, if you don't mind… I'd prefer it if we don't try to dig it out just yet.\"\n\nSunny scoffed, then grimaced and pressed a hand against his wounds. \"Yeah. Let's not, just yet.\"\n\nThere was another corpse they had to take a look at, almost exactly on the other side of the shattered volcano. Flying there took them a little bit of time, and when they reached the colossal remains, Sunny just stared at them with a peculiar expression.\n\nThe second corpse… had turned out to not be the second corpse. Instead, it was the lower half of the Cursed Monster they had already investigated. There was no explanation as to how it ended up all the way on the opposite side of the lake of lava, and no additional clues as to how the creature had died. Neither was there any trace left of the second Cursed Monster. It had simply vanished, as if it had never existed at all… just like the Snow Demon had.\n\nMaybe their bodies had drowned in the lava, maybe they had fallen into the sea of clouds. Possibly they had simply ceased to exist for some unknown reason. Anything could have happened, really.\n\nSunny took a shaky breath. \"Let's… let's explore more. We might find something else.\"\n\nAnd so they did.\n\nIn truth, he did not really hope to find more clues. He simply wanted to get away from the mangled remains of the Cursed Monster and do something to occupy his rattled mind. Sunny and Kai spent some time exploring the lake of lava. They studied the eerie, half-formed sculptures of volcanic rock protruding from it here and there. Being close to them gave both an eerie and unpleasant feeling, so they proceeded tо investigate the shores of the lake instead.\n\nEventually, they did find something.\n\n\"Well, what would you know?\" Sunny landed on a small island of cooled lava and looked down incredulously.\n\nHe seemed to have found his missing arm. It was still encased in the black carapace of the Jade Mantle, laying in the middle of a vast web of cracks that stretched from one edge of the small isle to another. The hand was missing a couple of fingers, but those that remained were still clenched into a fist.\n\nHis severed hand was holding onto something. Sunny crouched near it and tried to pick up an impossibly thin piece of torn string that protruded from the mangled fist. He failed at first, and only succeeded after putting some Will into his touch.\n\nThe string was infinitely fine, but also unbelievably durable, almost impossible to tear or cut. It resembled a single thread of black silk, or maybe a single string of a frightening spider web. All he knew was that at some point in the past two days, he had lost an arm while trying to cut that thread.\n\nLooking at Kai, Sunny remained silent for a while, and then asked in a subdued tone: \"So… what do you think happened to us?\"\n\nKai's expression was deeply disturbed. He shook his head faintly, then said quietly: \"I don't know.\"\n\nSunny let out a long sigh. \"Well, I have a couple of ideas.\"\n\nBut really, he was in complete darkness, just as full of dоubt as Kai.\n\nThat Cursed Demon… it must have been some kind of Mind Demon, if such things existed at all. Whatever Kai beheld on the snowy mountain might have been simply its vessel, while the Demon itself might have been a being of neither flesh nor spirit. It might have been like an idea, instead.\n\nAt least that was what Sunny imagined after witnessing all these unexplainable things. In any case, Sunny and Kai had fallen under the influence of the Demon… had maybe become its new vessels, even. They would have been simply debilitated at first, then fully taken once the morning of the attack came. Slayer must have restrained them before that, but that was as much as she could do.\n\nHow had she defeated the Demon and the two Monsters, then? Sunny did not know.\n\nHe vaguely suspected that the strings Kai had seen were how the Snow Tyrant controlled the rest of its figures. So, by severing one of those strings, Sunny must have liberated one of the abominations - the Cursed Demon itself, possibly - from under the Tyrant's control. Which meant that he had been resisting whatever had happened to him at least to some degree. Maybe?\n\nHe must have.\n\nAnd then…\n\nThere was no knowing what had happened then. Possibly the Demon itself had killed the Monsters. Maybe Slayer had somehow incited and dodged it until the sun rose above the horizon.\n\nIf the Demon had failed to eliminate the Ash figures and stayed on a black square after the end of its move… Who knew what could have become of it?\n\nNobody did. It was a complete mystery, and a frightening one, at that.\n\nSunny was in pain, tired, and deeply disturbed. He did not even want to admit how disturbed he was - it was to the point that missing an arm seemed a minor thing in comparison.\n\nPicking up his arm from the stone, he turned and glanced at Kai with a somewhat lost expression. \"You know… I have never lost a limb before. This is a first.\"\n\nKai smiled weakly. \"Really? I would hаve thought…\"\n\nSunny shook his head. He wanted to add something like \"well, unless you count the head as a limb\", but remained silent instead. He was not in the mood for that.\n\nEventually, he said in a concerned tone: \"Really. I guess… we've won, though? Should we be happy?\"\n\nKai did not answer.\n\nSunny did not speak for a while, either.\n\nSomehow, this particular victory - if it could even be called that - made him feel more troubled than any defeat."

    "content": "2379 No Way Back\n\nSunny had never found any answers.\n\nThe mystery of the Snow Demon remained unsolved, and he suspected that he might never find out what that creature had been and what it had done to him and his companions. Perhaps they would meet again, one day, in the dark reaches of the Shadow Realm. But since Sunny did not even know what the eerie Demon had looked like - or if it had even glanced like anything at all - they would not recognize each other. So, he could only console himself by the fact that the mysterious Nightmare Creature was dead.\n\nDisheartened, Sunny and Kai returned to the Shrine of Truth. Slayer was still leaning against the wall atop the sloping pillar, seemingly asleep. Sunny had never seen a Shadow sleep before, so she must have been truly exhausted by what transpired during the two missing days. He could summon her back into the nurturing darkness of his soul, but that would mean not being able to summon her again until her wounds were entirely healed. And that was a luxury he could not afford at the moment.\n\nAfter all, three more Snow figures were going to surround the Shrine of Truth come morning - most likely. Now, there were only five of them left on the board: two Beasts, two Devils, and the Tyrant itself. So, at least one of the three figures was likely to be a Devil.\n\nSunny closed his eyes, suddenly aware of just how beaten and battered his body was. He was missing an arm, damn it. Well, actually, he wasn't missing it anymore. He had found his arm, it was just not attached to his body. ', That's a bit funny.'\n\nGritting his teeth, Sunny dismissed the Jade Mantle and the surrogate arm he had manifested from the shadows. Then, he pressed the severed arm to the mangled stump and cursed quietly, concentrating on controlling the flow of his blood. Kai observed him with a peculiar expression.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nSunny looked at him and smiled darkly. \"Trying to regrow an arm.\"\n\nIn truth, even some Saints could regrow missing parts of their bodies - it just took a lot of time. Supremes were even more tenacious, but Sunny naturally did not have a lot of insight into how long it would take a Sovereign to regrow a limb. There was simply no data on that issue.\n\nHe healed a lot faster than most due to the Blood Weave, but still, reattaching a severed arm was going to waste much less time than cultivating an entirely new one. Plus… he was attached to his arms. They had gone through a lot with him. \"I need both hands for cooking, you know? As well as for, other things,\"\n\nHis attempt to lighten the mood fell flat. After that, neither Sunny nor Kai spoke for a while. Both felt disheartened. They might have survived the battle, but it was not due to their skill or effort. It was not even due to luck… there was simply no explanation for why they were still alive, which meant that they were only alive by accident.\n\nEventually, Kai sighed. \"I don't know why I am surprised.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nKai hesitated for a while, then smiled faintly. \"I guess it is because of you and Nephis. The two of you have a habit of making the impossible seem normal. You are powerful beyond reason, and the way both of you think is beyond reason too. So, sometimes, it is easy to forget that the things you do are not reasonable. They are not normal at all.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"It is not normal to defeat a god. In fact, it is entirely unreasonable to even try fighting a god - especially an ancient, malevolent, corrupted one. And yet, that is what we have been doing ever since entering the odd realm, isn't it? Not only that, but we've even managed to kill several of those fallen deities. You seemed to take it in stride, so at some point, I found myself assuming that that was how things were supposed to be. But, Sunny…\"\n\nKai fell silent for a few seconds, then looked at him with a slight frown. \"They're not. No matter how powerful we are, these beings are still Cursed Ones. They are former gods… they are literal beings of legends. The traumatic and dreadful kind of legends. So, I shouldn't have been surprised when something like that happened. Actually, it is a miracle that something like that had not happened sooner.\"\n\nSunny scowled, not entirely sure how to respond. \"Are you trying to say that I am reckless?\"\n\nKai shook his head. \"No… not really. Being reckless means that you have a choice between safety and danger, and we weren't really given a choice, were we? It is not like the Cursed Ones would not have come for us if we stayed still, here in this cursed place.\" He sighed. \"What I am trying to say is that, possibly, meeting that Snow Demon was a stroke of luck. It gave us a reminder that beings like that are beyond our league… so much so that we cannot even understand them, let alone match them. Well, some of them, at least. Every adversary we face can be our last. And what would you know? We managed to receive that reminder without dying. That's a good thing.\"\n\nSunny studied him for a while, then nodded slowly. Kai was right. Sunny had done well facing Great Nightmare Creatures, so he assumed that fighting against Cursed Ones would not feel much different now that he was a Supreme. But really, every single one of them was an opponent he could not afford to underestimate.\n\nIn fact, he had been lucky not to encounter any truly dangerous Great abominations, probably because most of the ones he had slain came from the jungles of Godgrave. In the Dream Realm, they were on the younger side, and not as sinister as those great horrors that had been wandering its terrifying reaches since the times of the Doom War. And Cursed Nightmare Creatures were on an entirely different scale, as far as malevolence was concerned.\n\nKai sighed. \"I also realized… that you were right.\"\n\nSunny glanced at him with a silent question. Kai remained silent for a moment, then spoke in a sober tone: \"Before all this began, you told me that a couple of Supremes would not be able to protect humanity, and that becoming Sacred was the only way for you and Nephis. You seem so immensely powerful to me, so out of reach, so I did not take it seriously enough. But now I see now that you were right. The Cursed Ones are already this frightening, and I don't even want to imagine what Unholy Nightmare Creatures arе cаpable of. I am not sure that I can. So, there is indeed only one way - forward. Whether we like it or not.\"\n\nSunny stared at him for a bit, his expression unreadable. 'A reminder, huh?'\n\nThen, he grimaced and cursed loudly.\n\nKai flinched. \"Oh… I'm sorry. Was I too presumptuous?\"\n\nSunny gritted his teeth and shook his head. \"No, it's just… I think my nerves are reconnecting…\"\n\nHe could suddenly feel his missing arm again. And while being reunited with it felt wonderful, it also hurt like hell."

    "title": "2380 Shifting Scales.docx",
    "content": "2380 Shifting Scales\n\nBy morning, Sunny's bones had reconnected, and his arm was not at risk of falling off anymore. That said, he could not really move it yet, so it just hung limply at his side.\n\nThere was also the problem of the missing fingers. Unlikе the arm itself, he had never found them - so the fingers would have to grow on their own, which was not going to be a short or pleasant process.\n\nNaturally, if Sunny managed to get out of Ariel's Game early, Nephis would heal him in no time… The problem was that he had a far greater chance of never leaving this odd place at all.\n\nAs the sun showed itself from beyond the horizon, three new Snow figures did, indeed, move to occupy the surrounding peaks. Both Sunny and Kai felt uneasy about scouting their enemies, consideгing what had happened the last time they tried, but they had little choice - going into battle blindly was a far worse prospect.\n\nSo, Sunny mustered his courage and asked Kai to take a look.\n\nThis time, his friend remained silent for far longer than usual. When he eventually turned to Sunny, there was a very odd expression on his face.\n\nSunny frowned, not liking it one bit.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nKai hesitated for a few seconds. \"Listen, Sunny… before I say anything… I feel that I need to mention that I have nothing…\"\n\nSunny pursed his lips. \"Stop stalling. Out with it!\"\n\nKai cleared his throat, then pointed at the northern peak. \"Well. There is no other way to say it. But there's… there's a dragon on that mountain.\"\n\nSunny blinked a couple of times, staring at his friend in disbelief. After a few seconds, he asked evenly: \"A dragon?\"\n\nKai nodded. \"Yeah… it's a white dragon. It's very gorgeous, actually.\"\n\nSunny stared at him some more.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\"\n\nKai chuckled nervously. \"No. Why would I joke about something like this?\"\n\nSunny raised a trembling hand and pulled on his hair. \"No, really? What the hell is this… how come… listen here, you!\"\n\nHe raised pointed an accusing finger at Kai. \"Let me tell you, I've been around the Dream Realm and back! And never - not once! - have I met a dragon without you around. What are you, a dragon magnеt? How the hell are you attracting all these dragons, bastard?!\"\n\nKai coughed a couple of times. \"Calm down, please. Well… true, people call me the Dragonslayer, and I have an Attribute of that name. But if you think about it, technically, I only ever encountered one dragon. The other one was myself, so that doesn't really count. So… you can't blame me for this dragon, alright? I have no control over where dragons decide to show up, or why…\"\n\nSunny stared at him with suspicion. It couldn't be a coincidence, could it? Every time there was a dragon, Kai was somewhere nearby. Granted, the same could be said about most members of the cohort, since they were usually in the same place.\n\nStill! 'Damn Dragonslayer…'\n\nSunny let out a long sigh, then winced and decided to let it go. \"What about the other two peaks?\"\n\nKai pointed to the eastern peak. \"That peak… seems to be infested with rats. I can't count how countless of them are there, because there are too countless. The whole mountain is teeming with them, and they seem to be… eating the mountain.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow. \"How in the world… actually, never mind. And the last one?\"\n\nKai hesitated, but chose not to point to the southern peak. In fact, he did not even look at it again. \"There is someone we've already seеn on the mountain to the south. It's the Devil from the tree… the one who looks like a human, or at least human-shaped. It knows we are looking.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, then added: \"The dragon seems to be a Devil, too. The rats are a Cursed Beast… the entire swarm of them feels like a single entity.\"\n\nSunny remained silent, thinking. A Cursed Devil to the north, a Cursed Devil to the south, and a Cursed Beast to the east.\n\nThings glanced quite bleak. He was hardly in a form to fight, and most of his shades could not be summoned yet. Slayer was in a rough state, too… her situation was worse than his, really. Just like Sunny, she could not move one of her arms, which meant that she could not draw her bow.\n\nThere was a day left before the three Cursed nightmare creatures descended upon the Shrine of Truth. The odds would not be any better tomorrow, either.\n\nKai looked at him tensely. \"How are we going to repel this attack?\"\n\nSunny lingered for a while, then smiled. \"Well, the answer is easy.\"\n\nHe looked at Kai and shrugged, wincing from the pain of his mangled arm moving up and down. \"We won't.\"\n\nAs Kai glanced at him silently, Sunny shook his head. \"I am not fighting two Cursed Devils and a Cursed Beast. So, instead of waiting for them to come…\"\n\nHe glanced east. \"We will attack, instead.\"\n\nHe had come to the Shrine of Truth to make his warriors stronger. And he accomplished just that - with the jade figures in his possession, Slayer and Kai would receive the third ash augmentation. As long as his Will strengthened them, that would make them as deadly as any Great Abomination.\n\nMore than that, his army - as long as it was given time to repair itself - now consisted of two Sacred shades and two groups of Great Shades. The Snow Tyrant, meanwhile, only had two Devils and one Beasts left. It was actually at a disadvantage in terms of pure numbers.\n\nWhat a startling reversal it was, considering its overwhеlming numerical advantage at the start. More importantly, the Snow Tyrant had to send all of the figures that had been protecting it into battle, with only one Beast unaccounted for.\n\nWhich meant that it was almost defenseless. So, there was no point in staying in the Shrine of Truth anymore. Sunny had the adversary where he wanted.\n\nInhaling deeply, he summoned the few Obsidian Wasps that had already mended themselves and sent them off to dig out soul shards from the remains of the dead Cursed Monster. Then, he turned to Kai.\n\n\"Prepare yourself. We'll be fighting another god in the evening.\"\n\nIt was time to do some rat hunting.\n\n'Thank the gods!' He would finally have something to eat."

    "content": "2381 End of the Hunt.\n\nIt was the dead of night when Sunny and Kai returned to the temple. Slayer was still resting, so he simply placed one of the jade figurines next to her and handed the other one to Kai.\n\nThe last one, though… that last one, he kept to himself.\n\nThe Shrine was tilted and drowning in lava, so placing the figures on the altar was an awkward task. Still, Kai could fly, so it did not pose much of a problem. As the third ring of ash was forming around his soul core, Sunny left once again, threw a wary look at the eerie sculptures rising from the lake of lava, and made his sacrifice.\n\nThis was going to be the last truth he would learn before slaying the Snow Tyrant.\n\nThey were going to leave the Shrine of Truth in a few hours, which meant that even if another Nightmare Creature fell to their blades, he would only be able to make another offering after conquering the Snow Castle - if it was similar to the castle of Ash. Sunny was not sure what would happen after the Tyrant died, so there was even a possibility that this was going to be the last truth he would receive as a reward in this accursed game.\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\nThe figure of the Snow Demon drowned in the lava, and Sunny found himself somewhere else once again.\n\nBut this truth was unlike the rest.\n\nSunny was in pain.\n\nHis nebulous body was being eaten alive by a terrifying curse, his secretive mind was being consumed by vicious illusions. His heart was being torn apart by indescribable dread, and his very spirit was broken, his will and desire to live teared from it by a cruel hand.\n\nThere was no solace for him, no reprieve.\n\nNo choice but to die.\n\nAnd yet, he refused to. He staggered, walking across the sand with unsteady steps, surrounded by darkness. Somewhere above, the ebony sky shimmered with the light of a myriad of silver stars, but their pale radiance was not enough to illuminate the shadowy valley, let alone warm his mangled, freezing body.\n\nBlood was flowing out of his mouth, spilling through the fangs of his mask as it shone with a beautiful golden light… with the light of divinity. Radiant blood was flowing out of the wounds littering his body, too, soaking the fabric of his dark mantle.\n\nStep. Step. Another step.\n\nSunny was running out of steps he was fated to make. There were only a few left.\n\n\"Aahhhh…\"\n\nA groan slipped from his lips, its subtle sound distorted by the mask.\n\nThen, another sound came.\n\nThe sound of leaves rustling under the foot of a predator, The sound of graceful wings parting the night sky.\n\nThe sound of an arrow piercing the fabric of fate.\n\nThe arrowhead struck him in the neck, and he was thrown to the ground.\n\nSunny fell to his knees, the drops of golden blood shining like precious gems on the sand. Raising a hand, he grasped the smooth black wood of the arrow's shaft - not too dissimilar to the ρolished wooden surface of his mask - and pulled the arrow out, shattering it in his grip.\n\nThe firm hand of the archer who had sent the arrow flying was much too weak to harm a being such as him. It only managed to pierce his flesh because there had already been a wound there, on his neck, left by a far more alarming foe.\n\nThe arrow was of no consequence…\n\nThe legendary poison smeared on its tip, however, was anything but. It was a poison that was not supposed to exist in the world anymore, and yet, here it was.\n\nA dreadful cold spread through his body with dreadful speed. Then, it invaded his soul, his mind, and his spirit.\n\nSuddenly, Sunny felt weak.\n\nHe even found it difficult to keep his eyes open. His broken body shuddered.\n\nCold, cold.\n\nHe was cold, and alone.\n\nHe was going to leave alone, unwitnessed… just like he had lived. No one would even remembеr that he existed at all.\n\nDeath was coming.\n\nIt came in the sound of soft steps, taking the form of a woman who walked quietly out from the darkness. The woman wore battered dark armor and a veil that covered her beautiful face, her long, luscious hair tied into a braid.\n\nThe starlit night cast a deep shadow onto her, but he could see her cold eyes clearly.\n\nHe could see his reflection in them, too.\n\nA nebulous figure shrouded by a tattered mantle, a mask of black polished wood covering its face.\n\nHe was Weaver, the Demon of Fate.\n\nThe mighty, dreadful daemon…\n\nThat mighty daemon was now kneeling in front of a mortal huntress.\n\nA stifled laugh escaped from the daemon's lips, made odd and elusive by the mask.\n\n\"You Nine… ah, how we loathe you…\"\n\nThe Demon of Fate knew the endless despair of struggling against Fate better than anyone else.\n\nThe Nine were nothing but pitiful mortals, but they were also fated. Their lives were a convergence of fate. To anyone else, they would seem tiny and pitiful, no more than vermin… but to Weaver, who could see the great tapestry of fate, their figures towered like those of giants, looming above, oppressing Weaver with their crushing weight.\n\nThe woman glanced down at the daemon silently.\n\nThe daemon smiled behind the mask.\n\n\"It was you doing, wasn't it? Oh, what a wicked trap you set for us. We have escaped our siblings… but it seems that we've failed to escape you, in the end.\"\n\nThe daemon knew the woman well. She had been stalking Weaver for a long time, this mortal with a pure soul. Sometimes, she came as a beast. Sometimes, she came as a huntress. The daemon had not seen her moving stealthily across the realms, enduring battle after battle all in order to grow stronger… but they had felt her figure growing closer and closer in the tapestry of fate, constricting them like a serpent.\n\nUntil they could not move at all, and there was nowhere to go.\n\nFinally, the woman spoke.\n\nThe daemon had thought that her voice would be triumphant, but it was simply tired.\n\n\"I know what you are.\"\n\nThe daemon was tired, too.\n\n\"If you know what we are, then you know what destroying us means. There is a price that has to be paid for slaying a daemon. Are you prepared to pay that price?\"\n\nThe woman did not answer.\n\nThe daemon let out a long, sorrowful sigh.\n\n\"You know nothing, child. You poor girl, it is too late. Please forgive me, if you can.\"\n\nThe woman unsheathed her sword then and plunged it into the daemon's chest in one fluid, speedy motion. There was no hesitation in her strike, and no mercy.\n\nThat nebulous figure fell to the ground, lifeless.\n\nThe black mask stared blindly at the starlit sky, then fell apart into a hurricane of sparks.\n\nThe huntress sighed deeply and glanced at the sky.\n\nAt long last, her task was finished.\n\nShe swayed lightly and raised a hand, touching her veil in confusion.\n\nHer lips moved subtly, producing a barely audible whisper.\n\n\"…What task?\""

    "title": "2382 Wrath of Mortals.docx",
    "content": "2382 Wrath of Mortals\n\nJust before the sun touched the horizon, Kai joined Sunny on the roof of the Shrine of Truth. He glanced ready for battle, the arrows bristling with the black feathers of their fletching in his quiver. Summoning the outer layers of his armor, the archer inhaled deeply and looked east.\n\n\"Lady Slayer has received the third boon of the Ash Domain. We seem to be ready.\"\n\nSunny nodded slowly, a distant expression on his face. \"Has she now?\"\n\nKai nodded.\n\n\"Yes. Why? Your voice, it sounded a little odd.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, then sighed. \"She is set to play a decisive role in this battle. I've just been wondering… about how capable she truly is.\"\n\nKa studied him a bit. \"What is on your mind?\"\n\nSunny smiled faintly and lookеd at the towering mountain to the east, its peak covered in snow. Eventually, he said: \"Well, the Cursed Beast we'll be fighting tonight is a swarm of rats. They are infected by Corruption now, but that means that they weren't at some point. Which means that there was a swarm of Sacred rats oncе upon a time. Isn't it odd?\"\n\nKai blinked a few times, prompting Sunny to chuckle quietly.\n\n\"I mean, it's one weird deity, don't you think? Who would want to worship a swarm of rats?\"\n\nHis friend tilted his head a little.\n\n\"Actually, you are right. I have not considered it from that point of view.\" Sunny shook his head.\n\n\"But then again, who said that Sacred beings have to be worthy of worship? Conflating divine power and benevolence is a very modern way of thinking about things. Actually, for most of history, people had not worshiped gods out of love or gratitude. Rather, they did so to placate and mollify the deities, hoping to avoid drawing their ire.\" He smiled. \"After all, mortals can't survive the wrath of gods. Not the other way around.\"\n\nAt that moment, Slayer emerged from the Shrine, still shrouded in ghostly smoke and cradling her mangled arm. Sunny studied her with a dark expression. \"Or at least it's not supposed to be.\"\n\nThis Shadow of his… ah, she was definitely an overachiever.\n\nSunny had a lot to think about and a lot to say, but he did not have any time for that at the moment. Instead, he looked at Kai and said: \"Prepare yourself to feel weaker than you are now. We'll be invading the Snow Domain once again, after all. You remember the plan, right?\"\n\nKai nodded somberly. \"I do. Leave it to me.\"\n\nSunny glanced west, where the sun had just touched the horizon, painting the sea of clouds in a million shades of crimson. \"Let's go, then.\"\n\nThe volcano - what was left of it - shuddered. The fantastical scene of ethereal obsidian bridges forming from the plumes of ash played out once more, just as breathtaking and spectacular as it had been in the past. But after seeing it so many times already, Sunny paid little attention to the great bridges that spanned the sea of clouds.\n\nInstead, he turned himself into a shadow… and wrapped himself around Slayer. Immediatelу, he felt himself fusing into her ragged, battered form. A sense of fierce power and cold confidence filled him, as well as of a sharp and merciless killing intent - much similar to his own, but also different. Subtle, determined… inescapable. He could vaguely sense Slayer's thoughts and emotions, all of them painted in hues of grey by her sinister, dark resolve. There was a certain… purity to her feelings that he did not share. Her black heart might have been filled with nothing but malice and desire to kill, but that malice and that yearning were pure, unblemished, and pristine.\n\nSunny could not really read the thoughts of his Shadows when fusing with them, but he could usually sense fragmented echoes of what they were thinking about, sometimes even see glimpses of their subdued, distant, dreamlike memories. In the case of Slayer, though, he could sense none of the latter… Just a vague impression of a vast emptiness, impenetrable darkness, and of an imperative need to hunt… to kill. The sound of the wind howling across the obsidian dunes, the lethal radiance of destructive essence storms… As if Slayer had only ever existed in the Shadow Realm, and that was the only thing she had ever known.\n\nOn a purely physical level, fusing with Slayer was an exquisite experience. She was different from both the indomitable Saint and the mighty Fiend - hers was a graceful, subtle kind of strength. She was nimble and agile like a dancer, but at the same time ruthless and furious like a prowling predator.\n\nSunny himself followed a somewhat similar path. The origin of his battle art had been a radiant dance, after all - so, he could appreciate Slayer's fatal grace and ferocious litheness.\n\nAs soon as Sunny took Slayer into his dark embrace, he could feel a raging torrent of power flow into her body. This Shadow of his had already been enhanced by three consecutive infusions of mystical ash, and now, she was amplified by the power of shadows, as well. The result was quite frightening.\n\nThat said, Slayer was still not in her best form. She was severely wounded, and Sunny was as well. Neither of them made for a good fighter at the moment, but together… together, they could easily pass as one.\n\nThat was why Sunny had decided to guide her in this battle instead of participating in it himself.\n\n'Well… good luck to us, I guess.'\n\nBehind them, Kai's voice boomed, as if commanding the world: \"Be strong!\"\n\nAnd with it, Slayer and Sunny suddenly felt amplified even more.\n\nThere was no time to waste, so Sunny did not waste any by sending her running across the obsidian bridge. Instead, he commanded the shadows to open before Slayer, and as she stepped forward, the two of them emerged from the darkness directly on the slope of the distant mountain.\n\nOne of Slayer's swords left its sheath with a quiet hiss. In the next moment, the pristine white snow around them boiled, and many feral rats rushed at them like a writhing avalanche of rotten fur and sharp, needle-like fangs."

    "title": "2383 Lord of Rats.docx",
    "content": "2383 Lord of Rats\n\nFor a moment, Sunny was disoriented.\n\nSlayer's senses were difficult to get used to. Each of her five senses was vastly superior and far sharper than his own - except for his touch, which had been elevated by Bone Weave a long time ago. Fusing with Slayer was like stepping into a world overflowing with an endless complexity of sounds, scents, flavors, and starkly vivid images.\n\nIt would have been overwhelming if not for the fact that Sunny had developed a staggering capacity to grasp and absorb new information over the years, as well as while rising in Rank. Still, Slayer possessed more senses than the mundane five, as well - a primitive version of shadow sense, for example, and the remainder that Sunny could not even name.\n\nAnd there were a myriad of dreadful rats moving simultaneously all around them now. There was the Will of a Cursed Beast bending the world, and the rules of Ariel's Game sapping Slayer of strength. It was enough to send Sunny reeling for a split second.\n\n'So countless,'\n\nSlayer, however, was already moving.\n\nAs an avalanche of writing rats descended upon them, she bared her teeth behind her torn veil and dashed forward to meet them. Her black eyes glistened with the cold bloodlust of a merciless predator, and ghostly smoke trailed behind her like a billowing mantle.\n\nAt that moment, Sunny felt something strange - something he had never felt before while embracing Slayer as a shadow. The flow of her essence changed, moving awkwardly in a way that was not supposed to be possible… but also purposefully, as if she was remembering something that had been second nature to her once, but then covered by rust as the years passed.\n\nLike she was attempting to channel her radiant soul essence into the sharp blade of her sword - not to satiate its spellweave and activate its enchantments, but simply to saturate the cold steel with it as she would her body.\n\nShe failed to achieve whatever it was she was trying to remember, but just barely. So, Slayer activated the enchantment woven into her sword instead.\n\nSunny had crafted two short swords for his murderous Shadow - one from the metal of the great chains holding up the Chained Isles, one from a splinter of bone from Godgrave. Both were enchanted to be dreadfully sharp and incredibly durable, as well as to return to her hand if she ever lost them. The sheaths of the twin swords were also enchanted, meant to mend the blades in case they were damaged.\n\nThere was a difference between the two swords, though. The active enchantment of the one carved from bone coated the blade with an invisible layer of penetrating force, which was meant to allow it to pierce the toughest of armors. The active enchantment of the one forged from metal, on the other hand, was not meant to pierce. It was meant to sever.\n\nThe enchantment generated a field of fearsome force and then folded it into a razor-thin plane that extended forward along the path the blade traveled.\n\nUnlike his other Shadows, Slayer could not change her size at will - compared to the huge Nightmare Creatures Sunny routinely faced, she was entirely tiny. So, he had thought of giving her a blade to cut down giants. Its blade was short, but the invisible severing field would be as immense as Slayer could muster.\n\nThe enchantment was meant to be used against titanic foes, but it was quite useful against vast swarms of vermin as well.\n\nAs the short sword cut the air with a hiss, the fabric of the world seemed severed along its path. Enabled by Slayer's raging, radiant essence, the cut cleaved a hundred-meter gash into the descending mass of rats, obliterating thousands of them. Blood, viscera, and pieces of pulveгized bodies were sent flying high into the air, and a crimson haze suddenly enveloped the slope of the mountain, painting the snow red.\n\nEach of the rats was technically a part of a Cursed being, but there were three rings of ash around Slayer's incomplete core now, fully saturated by Sunny's Supreme will, while Slayer herself was amplified by his dark embrace. So, even while weakened by the Snow Domain, she had no trouble destroying the small creatures.\n\nThat was the result of coming to the Shrine of Truth.\n\nThere was something wrong… something deeply wrong… happening to the rat swarm, though. Sunny sensed the eerie, unfathomable Will of the Cursed Beast swelling for a moment, and then, he sensed something that sent a chill running down his spine… metaphorically speaking. Sunny did not possess a spine at the moment, and Slayer was not the kind of being to be disturbed by anything.\n\nThere were countless rats on the mountain - they had been gnawing on it, slowly eating away at its stone roots, before rushing to devour Slayer. The rats were myriad, and yet, Sunny had still expected to feel their number lessen a little when Slayer destroyed a few thousand. And yet, he felt the opposite. In place of the thousands of slain rats, even more seemed to suddenly appear out of nowhere. The remains of their fallen kin were instantly consumed, and the swarm swelled, increasing in number.\n\nIt was then that Sunny intuitively confirmed the essence of his foe.\n\nHe had harbored a suspicion even before stepping on the snow-covered slope of the mountain, but now, he was sure of it. And that only made him feel more wary.\n\n'So I was right, after all. Damnation,'\n\nIn a sense, the rat swarm - the Rat King - was similar to Abundance. It also pursued endlessness, but while Abundance did so by wielding infinity, the Rat King did so by wielding… propagation.\n\nThe concept the Rat King personified was numerousness. Perhaps there had been a single Sacred rat once, a long time ago, but as time went on and it was consumed by Corruption, there were many. And then, there was a myriad.\n\nIn short, for every rat Slayer and Sunny destroyed…\n\nTwo were going to take its place.\n\n'Ah… that doesn't bode well.'"

    "content": "2384 Rat Legion\n\nThe only thing worse than a profane legion of Cursed rats… was a profane legion of Cursed rats that grew larger and larger the more you killed them.\n\n'D - disgusting…'\n\nSunny did not really have any negative feelings towards rats. In fact, he found them to be quite admirable creatures… kindred spirits, even. Loathsome rats whose flesh and souls were twisted by the loathsome darkness of Corruption, though, were an entirely different issue.\n\nCurrently, an avalanche of these repulsive vermin was about to swallow him and Saint, and worse of all, there was no obvious way to defeat them.\n\nLuckily, Sunny always planned contingencies, and today was not an exception.\n\nHis plan A was to simply annihilate the swarm of rats in battle.\n\nHis plan B, though, had been developed precisely in case the swarm of rats proved to be too immense to be eradicated with pure violence.\n\n'I hope Kai does well…'\n\nThe avalanche of Cursed rats was almost upon them when Slayer slashed her sword again, cleaving a wide path through it. She dashed forward, moving through the crimson haze, as the rats flowed past them on both sides.\n\nThe murderous Shadow remained calm - gleeful, even - but Sunny felt a strong desire to shudder.\n\nThere were too countless rats rushing down the slope of the mountain for each of the vermin to run on the ground, so they simply climbed atop of each other in a demented frenzy. Their mass formed towering walls on both sides of Slayer, rolling past her like a real avalanche of writhing grey bodies, berserk eyes, and needle-sharp teeth.\n\nThe worst part of it all was that the breach created in the rat swarm by Slayer's strike was quickly closing as the old rats mindlessly pushed forward and the new rats came into existence, threatening to bury her under their squirming mass.\n\nAnd since the whole mountain was infested by the innumerable swarm, there was nowhere for her to escape.\n\nAt that moment, an arrow hit the mountain higher up the slope, instantly causing a titanic explosion. A annihilating mixture of light, heat, and sound pulverized myriad rats, clearing a wide circle of bare rock from them.\n\nAs innumerable tons of snow were displaced by the explosion and an actual avalanche rolled down, Sunny opened a path through the shadows for Slayer. Before the wall of rats looming above them toppled and buried her, she stepped through the shadows and escaped into the safe circle created by Kai's arrow.\n\nThe shallow crater left by the explosion was surrounded by the walls of rabid rats, as well, and was only destined to exist for a few seconds.\n\nBefore it was erased by the carpet of grey bodies, Slayer cleaved a path through the rats again. And before that path was swallowed by the swarm, a second arrow fell some distance away, causing another explosion and clearing another patch of empty land.\n\nThe chaos continued. The writhing mass of grey bodies flowed like a flood, devouring the entire mountain, while Slayer moved through it and brandished her sword. Arrows rained down on the quaking peak like a heavy artillery bombardment, pulverizing innumerable rats. Slayer's blade cut down even more, and the stench of blood permeated the air.\n\nThe mountain would have become like a monstrous, harrowing slaughterhouse if not for the fact that torn, bleeding remains of innumerable rats were immediately devoured by their countless brethren… who only grew more countless as seconds flew by, enraged and emboldened by the nightmarish slaughter.\n\nSunny was, honestly… at a loss.\n\nHe had rarely encountered an enemy who grew exponentially stronger the more it was slaughtered, eviscerated, and killed. Slayer and Kai were dealing grievous wounds to the swarm, but the more wounds they dealt, the vaster the swarm became.\n\n'Whаt a vicious little menace.'\n\nHe was not sure what role he was supposed to play in this battle, apart from opening paths through the shadows for Slayer.\n\nAbundance had possessed a singular vessel, at least. Sunny had not been able to suppress its Will, but he managed to slowly poison it with his own. Additionally, he prepared tools to disarm the immense worm in advance.\n\nThe rats, however, were myriad. There was no single vessel for him to target, and therefore, he was not sure how to suppress the concept of ceaseless propagation that the swarm embodied. Neither did he know what opposite concept he could have channeled if not for his role of augmenting Slayer.\n\nAnd he did not have much time to think… time was not on his side, after all.\n\nNot only would Sunny have to retreat once the sun disappeared beyond the horizon, but the swarm would simply become so vast as to be inescapable long before that.\n\nHe even considered using that very power of the Rat King against it. What if he inflated the number of rats on the mountain to such a degree that the entire mountain collapsed under their weight? There was certainly a poetic lesson hidden in that approach, and it could have even worked in some other circumstances…\n\nBut not now.\n\nAfter all, Sunny needed the mountain to remain standing, because he could not conquer it if the mountain was gone.\n\nAnd if he failed to conquer the mountain, two Cursed Devils would descend upon him come morning.\n\nThat was a clash he wanted to avoid at all costs.\n\nSo, in the absence of a clear way to defeat the vile swarm of Cursed rats… Sunny could only put his faith in Kai.\n\n'Come on, buddy. You can do it.'\n\nHe had left Kai on the roof of the Shrine of Truth for a reason. Sunny had suspected that the Cursed Beast would possess a power that defied reason, and he had also suspected that its power would have something to do with numbers. Something like that was not difficult to guess, after all, because the worst part about a swarm of enemies… was that they were a swarm.\n\nAnd the world almost never failed to deliver on its worst promises.\n\nSo, Sunny had given Kai a special task. He wanted to exploit the power of the Snow Tyrant against its emissary…\n\nKai had to find the invisible string with which the Tyrant controlled its Beast."

    "title": "2385 Pure Soul.docx",
    "content": "2385 Pure Soul\n\nSunny reasoned that the Rat King could not be merely a swarm of mindless vermin - he had battled hordes of abominations before, and they were not at all like the adversary he faced today. The entity he was facing was indeed a swarm, but one guided by a single Will.\n\nWhich hinted that there was a single source of that Will - the origin of the innumerable legion of detestable rats that lusted to devour Slayer in berserk hunger. Even if there had not been, the Snow Tyrant would have forced it upon the Rat King.\n\nAfter all, it needed to control the Snow Beast figure somehow, and Sunny doubted that his enemy could freely create an endlеss number of invisible strings to subjugate each individual rat.\n\nSo, he had theorized that there would be a single string, connected to a single rat. That rat was the commander of the Rat Legion, hidden somewhere in the terrifying sea of squirming vermin - the vessel through which the Snow Tyrant controlled the Cursed Beast, as well as its source.\n\nFinding a single rat among myriads seemed like an impossible task. It was much harder than finding a needle in a haystack, to say the least. After all, neither the needle nor the haystack was supposed to move, let alone seethe and writhe in mad bloodlust on the quaking slopes of a crumbling mountain.\n\nBut if anyone could accomplish that task, it was Kai.\n\nHe had been the first of them to notice the existence of the invisible strings, after all. Sunny himself was not even sure that he was capable of perceiving them - but Kai could.\n\nAnd although he was not capable of differentiating the original rat from its myriad brethren, he could catch a glimpse of the Snow Tyгant's string again. And then… he could follow it to the target.\n\nThat was how Sunny intended to use his adversary's own power against them.\n\nThe problem, naturally…\n\nWas that he and Slayer had to survive long enough for Kai to succeed.\n\nAnd that was not only difficult, but also continued to get harder and harder with each moment.\n\nSlayer was like a dark hurricane, moving across the mountain in a whirlwind of blood and torn flesh. She had already been a force to be reckoned with in the past - a malevolent, sinister force - but now that she was enabled by shadows and ash, wielding enchanted weapons forged by the Sovereign of Death himself, her dreadful malice was simply awesome to behold.\n\nThe mountain was covered by the swarming rats entirely, so Slayer could only exist in the wake of staggering slaughter. She had to carve a path for herself with her severing blade, and when that was not enough, she had to escape into the small islands of fleeting safety created by Kai's annihilating bombardment. Sunny guided her through the shadows, matching the frenetic cadence of the alarming battle.\n\nThe slaughter was unimaginable.\n\nThe sight of it all - the crimson blaze of the sunset, the dark writhing walls of vermin closing in on them like mudslides, the plumes of fine red haze drifting on the wind - was unbelievable.\n\nThe noisе, however, was the worst - the ear-piercing, deafening cacophony of sounds produced by the myriad of rabid rats was grotesque, appalling, and utterly indescribable… especially so because Slayer's hearing was incredibly sharp, capable of catching the sound a needle dropping countless kilometers away.\n\nIt was to the point that Sunny thought that he hallucinating, hearing a hum of demented voices being born from the rustle of innumerable vermin rushing to tear his Shadow apart. Those voices were not voices, and the words they spoke were not words… and yet, somehow, he could still faintly understand them, at least at times.\n\n\"Hungry… hungry… we are hungry… we are, hunger…\"\n\nThat was what he imagined he heard, repeated a myriad times by the myriad of berserk voices, until it lost meaning.\n\nSlayer moved without reprieve, dancing in the gaps between the tendrils of the swarm that aimed to consume her. Her movements were speedy and graceful, but the slaughter she unleashed was utterly barbaric, slowly painting the whole mountain red. Sunny was appalled by the ghastly scale of the violence she was perpetrating, but at the same time, he found himself being enthralled by it.\n\nIt was truly a joy to witness a master doing what they were best at - to experience it all as they were experiencing it, feeling each step, muscle contraction, and reverberation of the sword.\n\nHe was quite familiar with Slayer's battle style by now, and yet, he had never felt her going all out like this before. Now that Sunnу had the first row to the dark spectacle of it all, he could discern subtler details about the way his Shadow wielded her blade.\n\nThere was a certain… sincerity to the way Slayer fought. He had noted how pure her emotion seemed, and that purity translated to her every move. There was no pretense, no hesitation to her macabre dance - just sincere, pure, and adamant resolve to maim, mangle, and kill.\n\nWhich was not to say that Slayer's battle style was unsophisticated or blunt - far from it. It was nothing short of beautiful.\n\nShe was just devoted fully to her every motion without holding anything back.\n\nHer intent and her actions were flawlessly the same.\n\nIt was a peculiar state of being, one that was alien to Sunny, and would be to most humans, as well. After all, humans had innumerable thoughts and innumerable experiences. Such a degree of single-minded certainty was impossible for most, if not all, and would only be harmful otherwise.\n\nBut Slayer made it work. In fact, she made it work splendidly.\n\nThe sincerity of her resolve influenced how efficiently she could wield the Will, as well. Since there was no barrier between her intent and her actions, nothing was wasted in translation - as a result, she could achieve far more with far less, displaying a level of resouгcefulness and efficacy that Sunny found wondrous.\n\nShe wielded the Will with incredible finesse.\n\nThat was why Slayer and Sunny were still alive, and relatively unscathed.\n\nHowever…\n\nWith every moment that passed, the swarm grew.\n\nThe paths Slayer cleaved in the mass of writhing rats grew narrower, the time the gaps existed grew shorter, and the walls of vermin surrounding them grew taller.\n\nSunny was not sure how much longer they would be able to last before the Rat King buried them under its revolting mass.\n\n'Come on, Kai…'"

    "title": "2386 Rat Race.docx",
    "content": "2386 Rat Race.\n\nWhen the end camе, it came suddenly.\n\nSlayer was rushing through a gap between two tides of vermin, her sword hissing as it flew at incredible speed, slicing apart individual rats who had managed to jump at her from the writhing mass of their brethren. The path she had cleaved was about to disappear, and there was nowhere for them to retreat to - Kai was late with his next arrow, so no island of safety had been created by a powerful explosion. Slayer was already pouring essence into her sword, preparing to activate its enchantment immediately after using it a split second ago, already - it was wasteful and dangerous, but they were short on choices.\n\nIt was then that Sunny felt a condensed and oppressive mass of barely contained power rushing at them from behind at awful speed. Almost at the same time, he sensed a speedy shadow flying across the obsidian bridge… the shadow of an arrow. In the next moment, the arrow flashed above their heads and clashed the mountain close to the peak. There was no fiery explosion, this time…\n\nBut what followed next was several magnitudes more violent. The mountain shuddered as an incredible amount of concussive force and sound was released in an instant. A myriad of rats were instantly pulverized by the obliterating shockwave, turning into a crimson haze. More than that, there was no island of safety created on the slope this time - instead, the impregnable stone simply shattered, and myriad tons of it were thrown high into the air. The fountain of shattered stone extended into the sky, expanding as it rose.\n\nThen came the deafening roar of the impact and the powerful tremors that made several sections of the fractured slope collapse.\n\nThe damage near the peak was much worse, though. In fact, the entire peak was obliterated, crumbling under its own weight and plummeting down. A gigantic rockfall turned the western face of the mountain into a scene of chaotic devastation, billowing clouds of dust obscuring the view as myriad rats were crushed and buried under the enormous boulders. Then, the debris that had been sent flying into the sky rained down, pulverizing even more.\n\n…That was the result of Kai using the final enchantment of the Supreme bow Sunny had crafted for him - the tried and tested [Death Dealer], modified to incorporate his latest insights into weaving. Kai had to have poured most of his essence into this one shot, sending his most fatal arrow fly. And there was only one reason he would have done that. Sunny wanted to grin.\n\nThe destruction of the peak of the mountain, the countless rats destroyed by the initial impact and the rockfall that followed… all of it was merely a side effect. Kai's true target was a single rat - the source of the Rat King. He must have found the invisible string and traced it to the source rat's back.\n\nAfter that, his task was easy… he had to clash that single moving rat among a million identical vermin, from dozens of kilometers away. What could have been simpler thаn that?\n\nAnd he did. Sunny was sure of it, because he could already sense the behavior of the swarm changing.\n\nHis heart was filled with vicious glee. The first change was somewhat subtle and hard to describe. The rats were not disoriented, and the Will of the swarm did not diminish in its harrowing, oppressive power - but it became wilder and more unbridled, losing all pretenses of guidance. That was because the rat swarm had escaped from under Snow Tyrant's control.\n\nThe second change was far more impactful, though. It only took Sunny a moment to realize that there was something lacking. And when he concentrated on that stark absence, he realized that no new rats had appeared to replace the ones killed by the rockfall.\n\nWith the death of its progenitor, the swarm ceased its endless growth. The Rat Кing was Rat King no more… now, it was merely a vast horde of starving abominations. And these nightmare creatures were already starting to devour each other. Sunny wasted a heartbeat observing the distressing sight of a myriad of rats lunging at each other to rend each other apart.\n\nMaybe if this was allowed to continue, if all the myriad rats were given a chance to devour each other… then, at the end, a new Rat King would have been born. A single dreadful creature who had feasted on the flesh of its kin, and absorbed the essence of the entire swarm to become the source of a new rat plague.\n\nBut Sunny and Slayer were here to prevent that from happening. Well… mostly Slayer.\n\n'Come on! Hurry!' She did not make Sunny ask twice.\n\nBefore thе violent tremors shaking the mountain could cease, and long before the dust of the enormous rockfall settled, Slayer had already resumed her barbarous slaughter. She was almost gleeful, eviscerating vast swathes of the frenzied vermin with each graceful swing of her sword.\n\nThis time, the gaps cleaved in the swarm by her blade closed much slower. And after a while, they did not close at all. Soon enough, Kai joined them, as well. He arrived in the form of a dragon, blasting the slopes of the mountain with the sonic booms of his haunting songs.\n\nThe sun was speedily falling behind the horizon, and the mountain was groaning, barely supporting its own weight - after all, the rats had gnawed on it in their hunger, eating away at its roots. Sunny, Slayer, and Kai were racing against time. There were too countless rats to kill, some of them buried under the stone debris, but still alive. Maybe they would have failed to clean every single one of them up, but luckily, Kai's vision could penetrate the slopes of the mountain, while Sunny's shadow sense could envelop the mountain whole.\n\nIn the end, he separated himself from Slayer and poured his essence out, manifesting myriad shadows to finish off the remaining stragglers. And then, just before the sun disappeared beyond the horizon, Sunny finally heard it…\n\n[You have slain an adversary.]\n\nLetting out a long sigh, he sat оn the ground and glanced west. The battle against the Cursed Beast, the Rat King, was over.\n\nThey won."

    "title": "2387 Godmeat.docx",
    "content": "2387 Godmeat\n\nJust before the last vestige of the setting sun drowned in the sea of fiery clouds, Sunny took a deep breath and glanced at Slayer. Surrounded by wisps of ghostly smoke, she was cleaning the blade of her sword. His Shаdow seemed… tattered, a little. One of her arms was still mangled and hanging limply, her armor was shredded, and even her veil was torn. Behind the veil was a face that Sunny knew all too well now - the gorgeous face of the woman he had seen in the visions, or rather, a version of it seemingly carved from flawlessly black obsidian.\n\nShe was the relentless huntress whose fate it had been to slay the Demon of Fate. Her shadow, at least. Granted, even after learning the unbelievable truth of Slayer's past, Sunny had his doubts about its veracity. Weaver was the master of deceit, after all. Was it beyond that nebulous scoundrel to sneak a lie into the game their brother designed to reveal only the truth?\n\nHe did not know. Not that it mattered.\n\nWith a sigh, Sunny threw one last look at Slayer and commanded the shadows to open, pulling her into their dark depths. A second later, she vanished from the devastated slope of the mountain. Just as the ethereal bridge connecting it to the distant Shrine of Truth crumbled into ash, her graceful figure appeared far away, on the tilted roof of the drowning temple.\n\nKai landed on the ground near Sunny as the mountain shook, rivers of lava flowing out of its shattered peak to announce thе end of the Ash Domain's move. He looked west with a startled expression. \"Sunny?\"\n\nSunny let out another sigh and sat up, rubbing his face with his one functioning hand. He remained silent for a few seconds, then smiled tiredly. \"Don't worry. I am not leaving our resident psychopath for dead.\"\n\nWith the move finished, he could not sense the shadows covering the lake of lava anymore. Neither could he see Slayer from this distance… but he knew that she was there, standing alone on the roof of the ancient temple and looking at him.\n\n\"I have a plan, so relax.\"\n\nKai hesitated for a few seconds, then sighed and sat down near Sunny, placing his bow on the ground with a trembling hand. He glanced utterly exhausted, having drawn its heavy string time after time with breathtaking speed. Kai had a peculiar expression on his face, so Sunny asked lazily:\n\n\"What's the matter? You seem a little out of it?\"\n\nHis friend lingered for a moment, then shrugged. \"Oh, it's just that we… we killed another deity. The previous times, it was mostly your doing, but tonight, Lady Slayer and I took the lead roles. Naturally, it was only possible because of your Will and the sacrifices we made to the Altar of Truth, but still. We killed a god.\"\n\nSunny studied him for a little while, then smiled. \"That you did.\"\n\nKai exhaled slowly. \"I just feel like I should be stunned and shocked by that fact, but honestly, I am not even bothered. Witnessing deities fall… has lost its novelty, it seems. Unbelievable as that might sound.\" He let out a shaky laugh.\n\nSunny stared at him silently, then shook his head. \"I mean… aren't you the guy who fought a flock of Spire Messengers as a Sleeper? And then jumped into the maw of a Transcendent dragon as an Awakened? Oh, and then there was the mad stunt you pulled in Verge? Why should you be stunned, let alone shocked?\"\n\nKai smiled shyly and scratched the tip of his nose. \"Well, true. Still, this repugnant swarm of rats was a god.\"\n\nSunny grinned, then glanced around, grimacing at the stench of rat fur burning in the flowing lava. \"Speaking of which… hey, how about we barbeque some god meat?\"\n\nKai changed in the face, turning almost green. \"T - the rats? Eat them? T - thanks, but no thanks!\"\n\nSunny laughed. \"Huh? Why not? You know, we mostly ate universal ration packs in the outskirts - also known as rat packs. It was all synthpaste and the driest, blandest crackers you can imagine, plus a disposable water filter. So, I actually always wanted to taste a real rat. Real rats were a rare commodity, though - the stronger kids hunted them down before the rest of us could.\"\n\nLooking around, Sunny inhaled the disgusting stench of burning fur and smiled. \"Look how far I've come! Ah… dreams do come true.\"\n\nKai studied him for a while, then forced out a polite smile. \"They're… all уours, then. By all means! I'd rather not stand in the way of fulfilling your dreams.\"\n\nSunny scoffed. \"How picky.\"\n\nKai had not wanted to eat the torn remains of the Cursed Monster because the manner of its death had been too eerie, and both halves of the hideous corpse were too disgusting. And now, he was refusing to eat perfectly fine, if a little cursed, rats as well… There was just no pleasing that guy.\n\nSunny gave Kai a look of reproach, then stood up and dusted off his tattered clothes. \"Well, suit yourself. I'm hungry, though.\"\n\nSunny might have been of the same mind as Kai regarding the eerie corpse of the Cursed Monster, but he was not going to hold himself back tonight. The poоr Rat King had never managed to satiate its hunger, so it was only proper to honor its damned memory by satiating his.\n\nHe found the Beast figurine while scrounging for rat meаt. And a little later, he found the sole soul shard left behind by the Rat King, as well - it had been buried under the rockfall, which was submerged in lava now, but Sunny retrieved the tiny crystal without much trouble.\n\n…The rat meat turned out to be diseased, and possibly even cursed. It was still delicious, though, and Blood Weave made short work of the contaminants. In hindsight, it was probably for the best that Kai had refused to partake in consuming the slain god's flesh.\n\nThere was more of it left for Sunny! 'Is his survival instinct really sharp, or have mine become completely dull?'\n\nSated and satisfied, Sunny returned to the western slope of the newborn volcano and sat down near Kai to watch the sun rise.\n\nThe final act of Ariel's Game was going to be decided once it did."

    "title": "2388 Lure.docx",
    "content": "2388 Lure\n\nThere used to be twelve Snow figures arrayed against the three figures of Ash on the game board. Now, only three of them remained - two Devils and the Tyrant itself. And Sunny was half a step ahead of the Devils, as well.\n\nThe path to the Tyrant was almost clear, but there was still a chance that the Devils would pursue him. If they did, the vaguely human-shaped Tree Devil would be of no concern, since it was further south than Sunny and his companions. The dragon, however, was north of the Shrine of Truth - so, if it moved east, they would have to clash with it eventually.\n\nSunny wanted to avoid fighting a Cursed Devil if he could. In fact, he dreaded that battle - еven if there were three Sacred shades under his command now. So, he left Slayer in the Shrine of Truth.\n\nIt was unclear how cunning the Snow Tyrant was and how well it knew the figures of the Ash Domain. However, it had shown at least some ability to act strategically. So, it would most likely be unwilling to leave the square of the Shrine in the hands of the adversary. Not only because the power of the Ash Domain would grow the more squares belonged to it, while the power of the Snow Domain would diminish accordingly - it was also because Sunny could easily return to the Shrine if his path to it was not cut off.\n\nThe truth of the matter was easy - the Snow Tyrant did not possess enough figures anymore to catch its adversary unless its adversary wanted to be caught. Sunny could wander the board indefinitely, playing a perilous game of cat and mouse with the two Snow Devils. He could stall for as long as he wanted, until his wounds completely recovered, for example, or until all of his shades restored themselves.\n\nAdditionally, he had in his possession the jade figurine left behind by the Rat King. His power would increase even more if he was ever allowed to reach the Shrine of Truth, the Ash Castle, or - presumably - the Shrine of Fear. He did not even have to keep Kai and Slаyer with him. He could send them to wander the miniature realm of Ariel's Game on their own, conquering peak after peak until the Snow Domain lost its territorial advantage entirely.\n\nSo… Sunny was betting on the fact that at least one of the Devils would waste a move to conquer the Shrine of Truth. And to make it even more alluring for them, he left one of his figures - Slayer - on the roof of the drowning temple.\n\nSunny and Kai sat on the stone slope and watched the sunrise silently. There was the gorgeous golden glow of dawn, and the plumes of snow freezing to turn into ethereal bridges. Neither of them spoke, still drained after the battle against the Rat King, and although a lot was going to be decided by what the Devils chose to do - or were commanded to do - both felt… Peaceful.\n\nEven if there were alarming battles ahead, they were not going to happen until numerous days later. And although they were still imρrisoned in Ariel's Game, the board was almost entirely empty of horrible Nightmare Creatures, which meant that they would not be surrounded and attacked unexpectedly. For the first time since the Death Game commenced, Sunny did not feel like a cornered beast. He inhaled deeply, enjoying the view of the radiant sun.\n\n'Come on…'\n\nFinally, the glass bridges were fully formed, and the Devils moved. Sunny held his breath, feeling his heart skip a beat.\n\n'Yes!'\n\nA wide grin split his soot-covered face.\n\nHis prediction was coming true - and in the best possible way.\n\n\"The Tree Devil is moving east.\"\n\nKai's voice was subdued. The human-like fiend was walking across the glass bridge, moving to the mountain directly south of their position. It was being sent on a hopeless pursuit.\n\nThe dragon, however…\n\nSunny did not need Kai to tell him, because he could see the dragon flying across the sea of clouds himself. The great beast glanced like a tiny dot from the distance, but there was no mistake - it was flying south, toward the Shrine of Truth. Which meant that nothing stood between Sunny and the Snow Tyrant anymore. He smiled happily.\n\nIt was odd… Maybe the Snow Tyrant did not care to bar his passage. Perhaps it even wanted Sunny to come as soon as possible, before he could fully heal from his wounds - in that case, moving the dragon away and opening a clear path served the same purpose as leaving Slayer alone in the Shrine of Truth. It was a lure.\n\n…Possibly the Snow Tyгant simply failed to control the dragon - after all, a Cursed Devil was a being of immense power, not much inferior to its own. In any case, the result coincided with what Sunny wanted.\n\n\"We're in the clear, Kai. We're in the clear…\"\n\nFinally, the end of Ariel's Game was in view. There was only one battle left for them to win - the most dreadful of them all, but still the last one: the battle against the Snow Tyrant itself.\n\nSunny exhaled slowly and watched the dragon fly across the vast chasm separating the two mountains. He thought he even saw explosions bloom as Slayer set arrow after arrow flying. And just when the dragon was about to reаch the lake of lava…\n\nSunny narrowed his eyes and dismissed her, calling her back into the nurturing darkness of his soul. Somewhere far away, the graceful figure of the murderous huntress dissolved into the shadows.\n\nA few seconds later, the Shrine of Truth shook as the gargantuan dragon landed on its roof. Robbed of its prey, the Cursed Devil let out a frightening roar - its echoes traveled across the golden clouds, reaching Sunny and Kai on the slope of the distant volcano and making them tremble. And soon after that, the Snow Domain's move was over.\n\nSunny let out a happy sigh and glanced at Kai.\n\n\"See?\"\n\nHe smiled in satisfaction.\n\n\"Let me tell you, buddy… a game has not been invented yet that I cannot cheat?\""

    "content": "2389 Final March\n\nSunny and Kai slept like dead men in the warm cradle of ash. This time, there was no manor of shadows to shelter them - Sunny was too hurt and exhausted to raise one, and did not feel the need to do it either.\n\nThey woke up from the sounds of the dragon roaring at the setting sun. The volcano Sunny had destroyed was now a mountain once again… granted, the mountain seemed crooked and low, not at all as tall and magnificent as the snowy peaks that surrounded it.\n\nHe was faintly glad to have left a scar on the realm of Ariel's Game.\n\nThe Shrine of Truth was now encased in ice and hidden in the depths of the mountain. The dragon rested on the peak, baring its fangs at the falling sun, as if warning it not to come closer. The sun, naturally, paid it no heed.\n\nSunny studied the distant peak for a while, then looked at Kai and asked in a tone of contemplation: \"Do you think all dragons come from Sun God?\"\n\nSevirax, the Ivory Dragon, was a descendant of Sun God. Granted, he was merely a Saint who could transform into one… or rather, had been. Still, all creatures except humans had either been made by the gods or were sired by those creations.\n\n'Except for the Nothing Creatures, I guess. And the The remainder. And the Darkness Creatures. Also the Stone Saints. Who else? Nephilim, as well. Actually, I take it back… not all creatures were created by the gods.'\n\nBut most of them had been.\n\nSo, who had created the dragons?\n\nKai hesitated for a while, then shrugged. \"I am not sure. Perhaps all white dragons do?\"\n\nSunny yawned, then гose to his feet and studied his unresponsive right hand for a few seconds. Then, he glanced west. \"Chances are we won't have to fight this particular white dragon. Are you disappointed?\"\n\nKai raised an eyebrow. \"Huh? Why would I be disappointed?\"\n\nSunny chuckled. \"Well, don't you want to add a third dragon to your collection?\"\n\nKai studied him with a sour expression, then shook his head lightly. \"I am not greedy. You are welcome to take this one, if you want.\"\n\nSunny grinned. \"Thank you kindly! I'd rather not.\"\n\nHe was indeed a little envious of Kai the Dragonslayer because of his glorious track record. How was it fair that Kai went around slaying dragons, while Sunny was stuck with rats, worms, and the like?\n\nThat hint of envy was far too slight to survive the sight of a Cursed Devil, though. So, Sunny had no desire to battle this particular dragon.\n\nHe sighed. \"Let's go. We'll be leaving this place soon.\"\n\nAt this point, Sunny had a choice to make. He could reach the Snow Tyrant in five moves at the earliest - coincidentally, that was also how long his shades would take to repair themselves. Slayer was most likely going to heal from her wounds in that time, as well.\n\nSunny did not see a lot of sense in delaying the final battle, so he was leaning toward taking the shortest path. There were three routes that would take him to the Snow Castle in five moves… and he did not have to take just one.\n\nHe could just as easily travel west to the Axis Tree, and then turn north. Kai, meanwhile, could travel north to the edge of the board, then turn west. That way, they would reach the Snow Castle at the same time - with the added bonus of possibly bringing four volcanoes into the Ash Domain. That was an alluring prospect…\n\nBut it was also too risky.\n\nAfter all, Sunny was only assuming that the Snow Tyrant remained in the Snow Castle. If it had left the heart of the Snow Domain, though… Then sending Kai out alone could mean sending him to die.\n\nThey could only see the neighboring mountains, after all. If the Snow Tyrant was waiting in ambush one peak over, or just happened to be in the way by chance, then there would be no chance for Kai to escape… not as long as one of the Devils chose to pursue him instead of Sunny, at least.\n\nSo, Sunny had to swallow his regret and abandon the plan of potentially expanding the territory of the Ash Domain. The two of them were going to stay together until the very end… for better or for worse.\n\n\"Ah. Am I not the best friend in the world?\"\n\nHearing that sudden proclamation, Kai gave him a sidelong glance, but wisely chose to remain silent.\n\n'I knew he would agree!'\n\nSunny was delighted.\n\nThey left the volcano at dusk and moved west, coming in sight of the Axis Tree once again. The mountain where they had killed Abundance was now to their right… to their left was the unexplored half of the game board that belonged to the Snow Tyrant.\n\nIn the morning, the Tree Devil and the Cursed Dragon both moved east in pursuit. Watching the mountain where the Rat King had died become covered by snow, Sunny could not help but feel uneasy.\n\nHe found it hard to believe that Kai would not end up fighting the Cursed Dragon, somehow. But then, he had to remind himself of one easy fact.\n\n…Not everyone was Fated.\n\nIn fact, very few beings were, and Kai was not one of them. He could end up facing the Cursed Dragon by some improbable twist of fate, or not. Actually, Sunny himself was not Fated anymore either, so the odds were in their favor.\n\nThe only probable future in which they would be forced to fight the dragon… was if they failed to κill the Snow Tyrant and had to retreat. Then, the Tyrant and its two Devils would descend upon them together, and they would die.\n\n'There is no way back, only forward. Failure means death. The enemy is overwhelmingly powerful, and mistakes are not allowed… ah, how nostalgic!'\n\nSunny smiled faintly, knowing that he was staring death in the face.\n\nThat felt like home. After all, he was the Sovereign of Death.\n\nThe next evening, as the falling sun set the sea of clouds ablaze, Kai and Sunny crossed the obsidian bridge and set foot on the titanic branch of the Axis Tree. They had reached the very heart of Ariel's Game.'"

    "content": "2390 Ye Mighty\n\nThe Axis Tree was so vast that it could only be perceived as a place, not as a thing. After all, it towered higher than the great peaks of Ariel's Game, which were already taller than any mountain on Earth - the branch Sunny and Kai were standing on was numerous kilometers long and as wide as a field, the ridges of the bark covering it more than spacious enough for two people to walk on.\n\nA complicated tangle of similarly enormous branches extended far down and high up, creating a dizzying three-dimensional labyrinth. A whole nation could have made their home on the branches of this great tree. Today, however, Sunny and Kai were the only people populating its desolate immensity.\n\nThe sun had just disappeared beyond the horizon, and although the sea of clouds still glowed with the last vestiges of a dreamlike crimson sheen, the night was already enveloping the world with a veil of velvet darkness.\n\nThe world was still, but it was not silent. Instead, it was permeated by the soothing murmur of flowing water.\n\nThe Axis Tree had been covered in snow just a few seconds ago. Now, the snow was melting, torrents of cold water cascading down the vast maze of titanic branches in a series of clear waterfalls. Sunny had expected ash and lava to replace it, but to his surprise, nothing of the sort happened.\n\nInstead, the great tree was simply stripped of its white mantle and left bare, its naked branches swaying gently in the wind. There were no leaves, no fruit, no sign of vitality to their vast expanse. In fact, countless of the branches were broken, while many more seemed frail and diseased.\n\nIt was as if the Axis Tree… was truly and utterly dead.\n\nSunny looked around cautiously.\n\n\"What do you think this place does?\"\n\nThere were five special squares on the game board - the Castles, the Shrines, and the Axis Tree. Sunny had mostly figured out the purpose of the first four, but he still had no idea what the function of the central square was.\n\nKai was looking around, as well. \"I don't see any structures. And I don't feel anything special, either.\"\n\nSunny contemplated for a while. There had to be some use for the central square, apart from how important it was for traversing the board. The player occupying the middle would definitely have an advantage, but that advantage alone was not enough to make the square special.\n\nGranted, there had only been four runes carved on the sides of the jade board - ash, snow, fear,%2\n\nStill…\n\n\"Let's explore a little.\"\n\nKai hesitated for a moment, then cleared his throat.\n\n\"Actually, before that,\" he pointed to the streams of clear water falling from high above. \"Wouldn't it be a shame to just waste all this water?\"\n\nSunny stared at him in confusion, then scoffed.\n\n\"Sure, go ahead.\"\n\nSoon enough, refreshed and clean for the first time in a long while, the two of them ventured to explore the labyrinth of branches. Kai was in a noticeably greater mood, even humming a jovial tune quietly, while Sunny found himself feeling like a person once more.\n\nIt was a nice feeling.\n\nThey wandered the Axis Tree for a while, jumping to lower branches or flying up to those that were higher. However, there was nothing special on any of them, and as Sunny and Kai drew closer to the trunk, it seemed less and less probable that they would find something special.\n\nIn the end, they ascended to the top of the tree and looked north, witnessing the next mountain over. Sunny had hoped that they would be able to see further than usual, considering the height of the tree, but he was left disappointed. Everything beyond the neighboring mountains was hidden by а haze, and even Kai could not see through it.\n\nThe three mountains in the north, however, glanced a little odd. Sunny was not sure what exactly was peculiar about them, but they definitely glanced subtly different from all the snowy peaks they had witnessed in the south.\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"No luck here, I guess.\"\n\nHe remained silent for a bit, then glanced at Kai.\n\n\"Possibly we should check the spot where the Tree Devil was staying.\"\n\nKai was the only one who had seen the Cursed Devil resting on a branch of the Axis Tree, so only he knew where that place was located.\n\nHe led the way. They descended along the immense width of the tree's trunk, eventually reaching one of the lower branches - the rest of them, if there were any, disappeared into the mist of the sea of clouds.\n\nThis particular branch was incredibly wide, especially at its base, where it connected to the trunk. That was where the Tree Devil had been sitting on the day they first saw it, surrounded by snow.\n\nThere was no snow covering the tree now, so Sunny and Kai immediately saw the anomaly. Here, not far away from the Cursed Devil's resting place, the surface of the Axis Tree's trunk was viciously broken, a dark portal opening into its eerie depths. Nothing but mist dwelled beyond the portal, and out of it, a river of something seemed to have flowed once, solidifying into an amber mass.\n\nFrom a distance, it seemed as if a river of molten gold had escaped the gargantuan trunk, most of it spilling into the clouds, while a little bit remained on the branch in small frozen puddles.\n\nSunny approached the nearest chunk of amber substance and touched it tentatively. It was smooth, hard, and cool to the touch.\n\nKai asked from behind him: \"What is it?\"\n\nSunny hesitated for a moment. Eventually, he answered in an incredulous tone: \"It's… it's literally amber. It's tree sap.\"\n\nStanding up, he glanced at the breach in the trunk of the Axis Tree and frowned.\n\nEventually, Sunny glanced at Kai. \"I… I think it's dead.\"\n\nThe breach was a wound dealt to the great tree a long time ago, and the pieces of golden amber were its blood.\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\n\"Rather, I think it was killed.\"\n\nThe breach in the trunk of the tree was enormous, but it was insignificant compared to its titanic size. Such a small wound would not have killed the Axis Tree unless it was simply an opening someone used to suck its amber ichor dry.\n\nMaybe the Tree Devil had not spent these thousands of years simply waiting for an adversary to show up. Maybe it had drained the young sapling of the World Tree of its boundless lifeforce and vitality, devouring it hungrily to nurture his own corrupted soul.\n\nIf so…\n\nThen possibly whatever it was that the Axis Tree was supposed to grant the Domain controlling it was long gone, that function of the Game destroyed when the great tree died.\n\nAriel's Game… was broken.\n\nSunny looked at the pieces of golden amber with a distant expression.\n\nIt was a little bit sad, and a little bit encouraging, to know that even things created by the great and horrible Ariel, the Demon of Dread, were not eternal.\n\nThe Nightmare Spell had been created by a daemon as well, after all.\n\nSo, maybe one day they would be able to kill it, too.\n\nA pale smile touched his lips.\n\nWhen Nephis first proclaimed her intention to destroy the Spell, it sounded like pure delusion.\n\nBut it did not seem that way anymore.\n\nLooking at the deadly wound dealt to the Axis Tree, Sunny suddenly felt for the first time that their goal was within reach."

    "title": "2391 Night Silk.docx",
    "content": "2391 Night Silk\n\nSunny was getting used to the feeling of being pursued. He and Kai had spent a peaceful night in the dead branches of the Axis Tree, and in the morning, the Tree Devil and the Cursed Dragon conquered the mountains to the south and west of it.\n\nHe watched the western volcano be extinguished and shrouded in snow, familiar with the sight. For a few seconds, Sunny allowed himself to contemplate turning back and attempting to take out one of the Devils come evening. It was an alluring idea, no doubt… facing each of the two fiends in sequence, slaying them, and arriving at the Snow Castle after having completely cleared the board.\n\nBut no matter how much he wanted to kill the Snow Devils and add them to his Shadow Legion, Sunny knew that it was a bad idea. He had not even recovered from his wounds yet, and both Slayer and his most powerful shades were still unavailable. More importantly than that, facing these powerful creatures was at best a gamble.\n\nHе might have allowed himself to become a little arrogant after attaining Supremacy, but the eerie events in the recent past helped him regain his senses. In truth, he had no business confronting a Cursed Tyrant in his current weakened state… even if he could wield his full power, a battle like that would be a lethal challenge.\n\nSunny was ready to die - losing one incarnation would be painful, but not disastrous. However, if his avatar died here, Kai would die too. And that was not something he was willing to consider.\n\nSo, he had to win.\n\nThe battle against the Snow Tyrant was unavoidable, but fighting these two Devils was unnecessary. Sunny was not going to gamble three times in a row if he could do it just once.\n\nWith a sigh, he turned away from the distant mountain and glanced at his right hand.\n\nA few seconds passed, and then, his fingers twitched faintly.\n\nA subtle smile appeared on his lips.\n\n'It's healing well…'\n\nThere was another piece of good news, as well. His soul had been healed completely - it happened in an instant, actually, not too long ago. This incarnation of his was isolated in Ariel's Game, but it still shared the soul with all the rest. That meant that they had suffered the agony of having their soul wounded at the same time as he had.\n\nBut… that also meant that Nephis could heal his soul by touching any of the avatars.\n\nThat was what must have happened.\n\n'The rest must be really confused right about now. I'll have new stories to tell when I come out…'\n\nShaking his head, he concentrated on weaving. The pieces of golden amber lay near his feet, glistening in the morning light.\n\nIn the evening, Sunny and Kai left the Axis Tree and crossed the obsidian bridge, moving north. The mountain did not offer them any resistance, its peak exploding in a fiery conflagration of smoke, ash, and lava. Sunny could almost move his fingers freely by then, which helped him weave at greater speed.\n\nThey ascended to the smoking caldera and climbed its edge on the other side, looking north - at the last mountain they would have to conquer before coming into sight of the Snow Castle.\n\n…And froze.\n\n\"What… what the hell is that?\"\n\nSunny could not help but say the words despite promising himself to hold back on using them for a while.\n\nBut he had a good reason to. The landscape in front of them… was not at all what they had expected to see. In fact, it was something that no one could have expected to see, because Sunny had never even imagined something like that existing.\n\nThe vast expanse of the chasm between the two mountains, was entirely obscured by a vast, tattered shroud. The three peaks in the distance were overgrown by that dark mass, as well, appearing like towering pillars enveloped in black spider webs. Enormous sheets of ghostly, tattered cloth billowed in the wind, stretching for numerous kilometers in all directions, their surface frayed and uneven, comprised of innumerable strands.\n\nThese eerie, tenebrous strands reached the northern slope of the mountain Sunny and Kai were standing on, as well, disappearing into the snow. As Sunny glanced closer, he saw that the dark mass consisted of myriad threads of flawlessly black silk, each of them as fine as a hair.\n\nThe entire northern side of the miniature realm created by Ariel was shrouded by this black web, as if a distressing spider had made its nest somewhere beyond the horizon.\n\nThe silk strands were so countless, in fact, that one could walk from where Sunny stood to the Snow Castle without needing the obsidian bridges or ever touching the clouds.\n\nHe shivered.\n\n\"Ah…\"\n\nJust what kind of horror had Weaver put on the board?\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, then said in a subdued tone:\n\n\"You know, Kai… Weaver's symbol wаs a spider.\"\n\nKai did not seem happy to hear that.\n\nSunny shook his head slowly.\n\n\"But actually, it was not Weaver who chose the spider as their symbol. Rather, people commenced to associate spiders with the Demon of Fate… after all, spiders are masters of weaving, as well.\"\n\nHe smiled darkly, remembering the spider silk he had found in the nest resting on the branches of the Soul Devouring Tree.\n\n\"Perhaps even spiders themselves came to see their tribe as servants of Weaver. But, come to think of it, even the name Weaver is simply a description of what that daemon was. The Demon of Fate never shared what they knew, so they would naturally never reveal their true name either. I'd imagine someone simply commenced calling them Weaver, and that was what they went on using to introduce themself.\"\n\nNether and Hope were also like that. Their names were simply descriptions of what they were… the Demon of Desire gave living beings hope, while the Demon of Destiny ruled the Underworld. The titles given to them by people had slowly become known as their names, but they were merely descriptors.\n\nSo, in truth… despite inheriting the cursed lineage of the Demon of Fate, Sunny did not really know anything about Weaver at all. Even their name was a deception.\n\nKai raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Why, exactly, are you telling me this?\"\n\nSunny cleared his throat.\n\n\"Well, it's just… I am trying to convince myself that the Snow Tyrant is not necessarily a spider. You know?\"\n\nKai let out a deep sigh.\n\n\"Do you hate spiders, as well?\"\n\nSunny forced out a smile.\n\n\"Not really. But I am considering starting to hate them right now…\""

    "title": "2392 Snow Castle.docx",
    "content": "2392 Snow Castle\n\nWhen the morning came, the sight of endless webs enveloping the entire world became even more eerie. The billowing, frayed tapestries of ghоstly black silk covered everything in sight, disappearing behind the horizon. The mountains were buried under them entirely, like gravestones overgrown by mold.\n\nCome to think of it, the mountain they had left yesterday must have been infected by the black silk as well - that was why it had seemed peculiar to Sunny from the Axis Tree. The webs had just burned away when the mountain erupted - but here, there was too much mystical silk for it to be consumed by ash and lava.\n\nSunny observed the nightmarish landscape silently, slowly clenching and unclenching his right fist. 'I don't like it at all.'\n\nThere were less than two days left before the battle against the Snow Tyrant, which meant that he had to start preparing himself mentally… for whatever it was he would face.\n\nBefore that, however, he had to finish the Memory he was creating from the golden amber of the Axis Tree and the three Sacred soul shards in his possession. This time, he wanted to create a charm.\n\nThe design of the enchantment had already come together in his mind, and he had already created enough strings of shadow essence to weave it. Now, Sunny was simply going over the mental image of the sorcerous tapestry while patiently carving the piece of amber into form with a knife made of shadows. The golden amber was impossibly tough, but it slowly gave in under the sharp blade. The form Sunny was carving was both gorgeous and easy - it was a star.\n\nThat star was going to help him kill the Snow Tyrant, whatever the Snow Tyrant was. After that… he was going to give it to Saint. She had gone without a powerful charm to fit her Underworld Armament for too long, so he really had to make sure that the Evening Star glanced worthy оf its future owner.\n\n'I'll be able to build on the initial enchantment later, as well. These Sacred soul shards are truly remarkable… the weight of the spellweave they can support is simply crazy. This еnchantment I envisioned is already more intricate and sophisticated than most of what I have done in the past, and it is nowhere near exhausting their potential.'\n\nSunny was pressed for time, so he had to be truly ingenious with the design of the enchantment. The solutions he had come up with to simplify the elaborate patterns, and therefore hasten the process of weaving, were nothing short of inspired.\n\nHe had even given the Evening Star a conditional limitation to greatly strengthen its effect when the proper conditions were met… that was actually an idea he stole from the Sin of Solace, that damn cursed sword. The Crown of Twilight relied on something similar as well, only replenishing his essence in the twilight of dusk and dawn… Come to think of it, numerous if not most of his most powerful Memories had been limited in some way or another. That was what gave them true power. Sunny had always subconsciously understood that principle, but he only fully realized how to make use of it now.\n\nThere was probably some deep lesson about people and their Flaws somewhere in there, but he was too engrossed in his task to go on a philosoρhical tangent. 'Two days, one night.' That was all the time he had left before facing the Snow Tyrant.\n\nThe first day passed in the blink of an eye, and soon, it was dusk once more. The obsidian bridge…\n\nFailed to come into existence.\n\nThe plumes of ash stretched toward the distant mountain and commenced to solidify, but got tangled in the billowing webs and crumbled without ever taking form. Sunny and Kai observed the eerily gorgeous scene in stunned silence, then glanced at each other warily. There was no bridge, but the Ash Domain could still move. So, Sunny manifested a pair of black wings, and the two of them flew across the sea of fluttering black silk, landing carefully atop the northern mountain. From there, they could finally see the Snow Castle.\n\nAnd the source of black silk, the Snow Tyrant itself, as well. 'W - what?'\n\nThe creature was so immense that even Sunny could see it with a naked eye. He forgot to breathe, looking at the peak of the final mountain with a pale face.\n\nOut there, in the distance…\n\nA huge black moth was perched atop the silken peak, its tenebrous wings covering the slope. Its legs were like obsidian pillars, and its antennae extended far into the sky, swaying lightly in the wind. The block moth was distantly similar to the Nightmare Butterflies of Ariel's Tomb, but also much more gigantic and dreadful than them. It was not even its outer appearance that was so horrible… instead, simply looking at it filled Sunny with a dreadful, eerie feeling of hopelessness. Something about the titanic moth was so malevolent, frightening, and deeply wrong that he felt the desire to give up and cease his senseless resistance. He was already doomed, after all.\n\nBut that was not why Sunny was so stunned. Rather, it was because the sinister black moth felt, peculiarly familiar. Come to think of it… The black silk felt familiar as well.\n\nSunny shivered, and then whispered quietly: \"I… I know it.\"\n\nKai looked in surprise. \"What?\"\n\nSunny raised his right hand and pointed at the horrible creature perching atop the Snow Castle. \"I know that creature… or at least its kind.\"\n\nHe had never met the Snow Tyrant, but he knew it well. It was the Puppeteer. It was a Puppeteer Worm, who had become the Puppеteer Moth after escaping from the chrysalis of human minds it had twisted, used as nourishment, and then destroyed.\n\nSunny remembered the description of the Puppeteer's Shroud.\n\n[A worm of doubt once found its way into a righteous king's heart. With time, the king was devoured from the inside and became its puppet. A lifetime later, the Puppeteer Worm escaped from the king's dead body, leaving behind a cocoon of black silk. No one knows where it went; however, once people dared to approach the silent castle, they found the silk among the mountains of gnawed bones and fashioned it into an armor.]\n\n…He did not know whether the creature he was facing was the same Puppeteer Worm who had been responsible for the birth of the Mountain King, or simply the most accomplished member of their harrowing kind. All he knew was that the description of his old armour failed to mention what a larva evolved to after leaving its chrysalis. He was looking at what it had become right now."

    "content": "2393 Who Puppeteers the Puppeteers\n\nAs darkness shrouded the world, Sunny and Kai sought shelter from the eerie gaze of the Puppeteer on the other side of the mountain. Sunny sat in the ash, his six hands dancing in the air as he wove the complicated enchantment of the Evening Star, one of them was giving him trouble, but he worked through the stiffness and the pangs of ρain. His expression was both focused and distant, as if he was in a state of flow, but also rattled to the core.\n\nAs the radiant patterns of the sorcerous tapestry took form, he could feel his shades being mended. The Obsidian Wasps were restored first, then the Shadow Wolves and Abundance… the Wolf was going to recover soon, too. Slayer was close to being fully healed as well. The shade of the Rat King, meanwhile, had never been vanquished, so Sunny could summon it at any second as long as he wished to.\n\n'The Puppeteer Moth… really, now?' Sunny was a little shaken.\n\nLocking these feelings in an isolated partition of his mind, he allowed that part of him to take control of his mouth and spoke quietly: \"What a splendid coincidence.\" Meeting an Nightmare Creature that was connected to his First Nightmare here was truly unexpected. Unbelievable, even. What were the chances? It was almost as if someone - a certain nebulous daemon, perhaps - had pulled the strings behind the scenes to make it happen. Not the strands of black silk that the Puppeteer used, though, but an entirely different kind.\n\nThe Strings of Fate themselves, maybe. …Who was the real puppeteer here, then?\n\nSuddenly, the giant black moth perching on the peak of a towering mountain did not seem so traumatic anymore. It even seemed a little pitiful. But, naturally, that feeling only lasted for a moment.\n\nKai, who had been staring at the stars idly, turned to look at Sunny. \"But how do you know that horror?\" Sunny remained silent for a few seconds, engrossed in weaving, then shrugged. \"It was mentioned in the description of a Memory I owned. It was the second Memory I had ever received, actually… and its description was quite memorable. Because of how creepy it was. Who knew I'd meet that creepy Nightmare Creature myself, one day?\"\n\nHe sighed, then shook his head slowly. \"But, actually, it is a good thing. It is a wonderful thing, even.\"\n\nSunny glanced at Kai and tried to smile. \"Knowledge is the origin of power, after all. Few things are more important than knowing your adversary. I thought we would have to go into battle against the Snow Tyrant blind, but would you look at that? Now, we don't have to. We know quite a lot about it. In fact, we know the things that matter most.\" He glanced away and contemplated the situation for a while.\n\nEventually, Sunny said: \"The Puppeteers Moth… can also be called Doubt, I guess. That is the essence of its power. It infects the hearts of living beings with doubt and turns them into puppets - in other words, it is an immensely potent manipulator. I hesitate to say that the Puppeteer specializes in mind attacks, because at its level of power, these distinctions are somewhat meaningless… but fundamentally, that is what it does.\" He took a deep breath, then smiled.\n\n\"Which means that we are actually in a highly advantageous position. These types of Nightmare Creatures usually rely heavily on their insidious powers and, most of all, on their thralls - but they themselves are relatively weak and frail when it comes to physical confrontations. And what did we do here in Ariel's Game?\" Kai studied him for a few seconds.\n\n\"We killed most of this creature's thralls and put ourselves in a position to attack it when it's alone.\" Sunny nodded. \"Indeed. That is what we did. So, in a way, we are incredibly lucky. Of all the Cursed Tyrants in the world, this one might just be the easiest to kill - considering the circumstances, that is. Not that killing it will actually be easy, naturally. A Cursed Tyrant is still a Cursed Tyrant.\"\n\nHe exhaled slowly. \"We got rid of most of its thralls and outran those who remain, true. The Puppeteer is huge and monstrous, but it won't be that fearsome in a battle - relatively speaking, I mean. I'd say… between that thing and the Wolf, the Wolf would be more furious.\" There was a long stretch of silence, and then Sunny added in a concerned tone: \"But that does not mean that facing the Puppeteer won't be infinitely more hazardous than facing the Wolf was. That is, naturally, because while we did kill most of its puppets, the real difficulty will be not becoming its puppets ourselves.\"\n\nSunny could not help but shiver. \"I would imagine… that a Cursed Tyrant can subjugate someone like us in an instant, as long as we give it a chance. It will make us doubt ourselves first, and then, before we know it, there will be invisible strings wrapped around our hearts.\"\n\nDoubt… that was the weapon the Puppeteer would use against them. Doubt was truly an insidious concept because no human was really immune to it. Even Supremes like Sunny were susceptible to doubt, as for Saints like Kai… Sunny glanced at his friend and shook his head.\n\n\"Actually, I am not really worried about you.\" Kai raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"You're not? But… I am quite an insecure person. I doubt myself all the time.\" Sunny smiled faintly. \"That is exactly what makes you dreadful prey for the Puppeteer. You do indeed seem to suffer from self-doubt a lot… and yet, you have never allowed it to control you. On the contrary, you have overcome yourself at every step of the way - it is like you've been training for this exact moment all your life, really.\"\n\nKai, despite his lack of confidence, was a faultlessly dependable person. He never failed to rise to the occasion - even if he struggled to get there more than the rest of them did. Sunny sighed and shook his head.\n\n\"In truth… I am much more worried about myself.\""

    "content": "2394 Confluence of Contradictions\n\nKai smiled at first, as if assuming that Sunny was joking, then looked at him with surprise after realizing that he was telling the truth.\n\n\"You are worried about yourself more than you are about me?\"\n\nSunny simply nodded.\n\n\"Yes. I am… especially vulnerable to what that thing has in store for us.\"\n\nKai remained silent for a few seconds, then shook his head.\n\n\"I find it hard to believe. You are a Supreme, after all. Didn't you tell me yourself that a Sovereign is someone who dares to bend the world to their will? How can someone be that obstinate and doubt themselves at the same time?\"\n\nSunny glanced at him with a dark expression and shrugged.\n\n\"Well, what can I say? People are comρlicated creatures. They can be two different things at the same time. So, I can be sure of myself so much as to force the world to agree with how I feel, but also doubt every single thing I do.\"\nHe was indeed someone who possessed a Will sharp enough to cut the world.\nBut, at the same time, Sunny's existence was… deeply ambivalent.\n\nHe loved Nephis and enjoyed her affection, as well. But, at the same time, he always doubted her feelings for him and questioned his place in her life. The person she knew was only a husk of the real Sunny, after all.\n\nSo, he wanted to reclaim his fate and make her - and everyone else - remember him. But, at the same time, he wasn't really sure that he wanted it desperately enough to pay the price of becoming bound again.\n\nHe was determined to resist the horrors of the Nightmare Spell and protect humanity, but at the same time, he was hiding his existence from everyone, forced into the shadows by the cursed lineage of the Forgotten God.\n\nSunny was a confluence of irreconcilable contradictions on a good day, and a bad day… he was one push away from losing control and falling into a murderous frenzy.\n\nAll these conflicting emotions had been simmering quietly in the background as he lived his life. Usually, they were not a problem.\n\nBut tomorrow, each of the unresolved doubts he harbored would become ammunition the Puppeteer could use to destroy him. Each of them was a crack in his armour through which the enemy blade could slide.\n\nSo…\n\nTomorrow's battle was not going to be fun for Sunny.\n\nHe groaned.\n\n'Ah. I really hate Nightmare Creatures who mess with my mind the most…'\n\nShaking his head, Sunny resumed weaving the enchantment of the Evening Star and grumbled:\n\n\"Well… you don't have to worry about me, really. I'll handle it. If everything else fails, pure spite has never let me down.\"\n\nHis expression turned concerned.\n\n\"That said, I expect the battle against the Puppeteers to be horrible enough to push me to the limit. Far beyond my limit, really. I might be forced to resort to doing something really desperate… if I do, your role will be the most important. You will have to help me come back.\"\n\nKai frowned.\n\n\"Come back? What do you mean?\"\n\nSunny smiled faintly.\n\n\"It's easy, really. You'll have to make me remember myself. By reminding me who I am.\"\n\nKai stared at him for a while, then cleared his throat.\n\n\"But, Sunny… I am sorry to say this, but despite our wonderful rapport in these last couple of weeks… I don't really know who you are. We are barely acquainted.\"\n\nSunny let out a laugh.\n\n\"Fair enough.\"\n\nThen, he scowled.\n\n\"No, wait. What do you mean, barely acquainted? You and I are best friends! We fought side by side and killed literal gods together. We rolled in the same mud and ate the same rats. Are there even a closer pair in the world than us?\"\n\nKai coughed.\n\n\"I didn't eat the rats, though.\"\n\n'Oh, right. He refused to partake in the rat barbeque, the fool.'\n\nSunny sighed.\n\nNaturally, Kai was right.\n\nHow could Kai make Sunny remember himself if he himself could not even remember the real Sunny?\n\nIt sounded like a problem, but actually, the answer was quite obvious. In fact, Sunny had experienced a very similar situation once, only his role now was the opposite of what it had been back then.\n\nA long time ago, Nephis had taught him how to make her escape the mind hex of the Soul Devourer, at least to a degree. All he had to do was recite three names to her - the names of the people she hated, and would therefore remind her of the most important thing in her life. Her ardent desire to destroy the Spell.\n\nAster, Song, Vale.\n\nSunny had to come up with an \"Aster, Song, Vale\" of his own.\n\nHe hesitated for a while, then said:\n\n\"Just recite a few names to me, Nephis, Cassie, Effie, Kai, Rain, Jet. If that doesn't help, throw in Noctis and Ananke. Aiko, Julius, Beth… Kim, Luster, Quentin, Dorn, Belle, Samara, Obel. Hmm. That should do it, I think.\"\n\nThese were the strongest connections to his sense of self he possessed in the absence of a True Name. The tethers that bound Sunny to the world, and therefore shaped him.\n\nIf anything could remind him of who he was, and what was most important to him, it was these names. In a odd way… these few words were the most meaningful summation of his life.\n\nKai gave him a odd look, then nodded slowly.\n\n\"Alright. I'll remember.\"\n\nHe lingered for a while before adding:\n\n\"I must admit that I feel a bit weird about my name being there, though.\"\n\nSunny grinned.\n\n\"What can I say? You make an impression.\"\n\nWith that, he beckoned Kai to come closer.\n\n\"Oh, by the way… I am going to punch you really hard now.\"\n\nKai blinked a couple of times.\n\n\"Huh? What? Why?\"\n\nSunny shrugged nonchalantly.\n\n\"You see the horizon? The sun is going to rise soon. I doubt that the Puppeteer will leave the Snow Castle, but it can surely subject us to some kind of terrifying mind attack without moving. You don't want to endure a mental attack of a Cursed Tyrant more times than necessary, do you?\"\n\nKai moved back a little, a wary expression on his face.\n\n\"I don't, but what does it have to do with me getting punched?!\"\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"I mean, the best way to avoid a mental attack is to be unconscious. That's just common sense. So, come closer… it will only hurt a little…\"\n\nKai, however, did not come closer.\n\nA few moments later, a cloud of ash rose above the slope of the towering volcano."

    "content": "2395 Check\n\nIn the end, Sunny did not punch Kai into unconsciousness. The charming archer did, however, put himself into a state of deep slumber by commanding himself to sleep without seeing any dreams - Sunny remained nearby, standing guard above his sleeping figure while focusing completely on weaving.\n\nWhen the sun rose and an ethereal bridge of glistening glass formed between the Snow Castle and the fuming volcano, a terrifying mental attack did, indeed, descend upon him like divine punishment. Sunny winced as his hands faltered, a sudden discord introduced into the vast tapestry of essence strings he was weaving.\n'Is it playing with me?'\n\nShaking his head, he corrected the flawed pattern and continued with his work. The Puppeteer seemed to be probing his mental defenses. Even then, that single distressing attack easily pierced his resistances and the invisible armor of Will he had forged around himself, forcing its way into his mind. Sunny felt himself reeling, an insidious presence taking root in his head. His sense of reality started to fall apart.\n\nGrumbling under his breath, Sunny partitioned the compromised part of his mind and isolated it from the rest of him. It helped to cope with the insidious, irresistible mental invasion of the Puppeteer… but only for a short while.\nSoon enough, the tendrils of mind - altering corruption spread beyond the walls Sunny had erected, infecting more of him. Luckily, it was not the capital letter Corruption, but simply the mental plague summoned into existence by a Cursed Tyrant instead…\n'Luckily? Does that word really apply here?'\nSunny smiled darkly.\n'Just a fallen god taking over my mind. No big deal,'\nHe isolated the newly compromised parts of his mind too.\n'Let's see who'll last longer, bastard.'\n\nSunny had dеveloped quite a breathtaking ability to split his mind into innumerable streams over the years, after all. From perceiving the world through his shadows, to controlling seven incarnations, to commanding the vast Shadow Legion and watching over the members of the Shadow Clan… he was quite adept at compartmentalization by now. As the sun was rising from beyond the horizon, he and the Puppeteer played an eerie game.\n\nThe giant black moth slowly conquered more and more of Sunny's mind, while Sunny calmly quarantined the contaminated parts and went on weaving. It grew more and more difficult as time went on, however. His hands slowed down, and the vision of the vast pattern of essence strings he held in his mind turned blurry. By the end of it all, Sunny halted completely, staring into the distance with an absent expгession. He was uncomfortably close to starting to drool.\n\nThen, the sun separated from the sea of molten gold it had turned the clouds into and hovered above the horizon, slowly climbing up. The ethereal glass bridge evaporated, and at the same time, the foreign presence that had been slowly consuming his mind retreated in an instant. Sunny let out a shaky breath and reassembled his mind into a single whole, swaying lightly as he did. He rеmained motionless for a few seconds, then resumed weaving with a concerned expression. His lips were pursed, and his voice was subdued:\n\"Ah… that was quite unpleasant.\"\nAnd it had been merely a probing attack, at that. Experiencing the full brunt of the Puppeteer's might would be a far more appalling experience. Sunny grimaced.\n\nThroughout the day, as the weave of the Evening Star came together, the things he had been waiting for happened one after another. Kai woke up from his deep slumber. The Wolf and its pack were fully mended. Slayer recovered from her wounds almost at the very last moment and rose from his shadow, just as full of malice and malevolence as she had been before.\n\nThe murderous Shadow had been absent for a few days, so he had to fulfill the conditions of their deal and make a blood sacrifice to her once more. Slayer drank deeply of his blood, and once again, her obsidian eyes seemed to ignite with a hint of remembrance for a few fleeting seconds. But then, they slowly reverted to being cold and unfeeling, devoid of their splendid luster.\n\nThis time, for the first time, Sunny felt disturbed by the subtle change that had briefly happened to his Shadow. He could not help but ask himself once again…\n'Did she? Did she really kill Weaver?'\n\nThe graceful Shadow stood motionlessly by his side, her hollow eyes betraying no emotion. In the end, Sunny had no choice but to look away and concentrate on finishing the last patterns of the vast spellweave he was creating. It was coming together well.\nThe Evening Star was the first Sacred Memory he would create. And although it was not entirely finished, still, he could already tell how different it was from all the other Memories he had created.\n\nThat was because of its very nature. A Sacred Memory was an immensely powerful thing - powerful enough to interfere with causality and bend the laws of existence, even, just like deities could. However, it was just that, a thing. It possessed neither will nor intent, and therefore, it lacked the authority to achieve what it was designed to do.\nHow could it function, then?\nThe same way the lesser Memories functioned, naturally - since Memories did not have souls, they strengthened by the soul essence of their master. Similarly, a Sacred Memory had to strengthened by the soul essence, the spirit essence, and, most importantly, the Will of its master to realize its potential.\nNot just anyone would be able to use the Evening Star to its full extent.\n\nSunny sighed.\n'I still have ways to go…'\nWeaver's Mask and the Shadow Lantern did not have the same problem, after all. They were Divine Memories that even a mere Awakened could use, which meant that whoever had created them infinitely more proficient at weaving than Sunny was. Well, naturally, they were. After all, Weaver's Mask had been created by none other than the Demon of Fate, while the Shadow Lantern was a replica of Shadow God's relic created by the Nightmare Spell.\n'I'll get there, someday. Maybe,'\n\nThe sun was already rolling toward the horizon by the time Sunny completed his sorcery. The breathtaking star carved out of golden amber lay on his palm, its intricately engraved surface glistening in the eventide glow. He sighed, then manifested the Jade Mantle and brought the Evening Star to the center of his polished black breastplate. Ther armor swallowed it, and as the Sacred charm drowned in the dark stonelike metal, disappearing without a trace, it was slotted into the Underworld Armament.\nPouring his essence and Will into Evening Star, Sunny felt a subtle power flow into his limbs.\n'Works as a charm…'\nHe smiled darkly, deactivated the enchantment, and rose to his feet.\nThe sun would soon touch the sea of clouds.\n\nThe battle against the Puppeteer was about to commence. Throwing a look at Kai, Sunny lingered for a few moments and asked:\n\"How about it? Are you ready to get the hell out of this dreadful place?\"\nKai nodded calmly.\n\"Oh, I am. I've been dreaming of taking a proper shower for a week straight.\"\n'Of course he has.'\nSunny sighed, then glanced at Slayer.\n\"What about you? Have something to say to me?\"\nSlayer did not deem it worthy to give him an answer. Instead, she simply checked if her swords slid out of their sheathes smoothly.\nSunny shook his quietly and glanced north.\n\nThe sea of clouds was drowning in darkness in the east while burning with a fiery crimson glow in the west. The plumes of ash were stretching toward the Snow Castle like black tendrils.\nSoon, they turned into an obsidian bridge, its surface glowing as if illuminated by innumerable embers. Taking a step forward, Sunny called upon the shadows and ash. As he stepped оnto the bridge, a tide of darkness followed him like a boundless mantle."

    "title": "2396 Evening Star.docx",
    "content": "2396 Evening Star\n\nAs Sunny walked across the bridge, bringing the Ash Domain with him, the huge black moth perching on the peak of the distant white mountain shifted a little. Its size was so immense that, from a distance, it seemed as if the mountain itself moved.\n\nSuddenly, he could sense something vast, ancient, and utterly alien gazing at him. It was as if everything about him was revealed under that frightening gaze - the entity studied him with a dispassionate thoroughness, like one would study a strange and curious specimen after dissecting its body.\nThen, the entity seemed to lose interest. The heavy gaze followed Sunny, but it felt far less penetrating than before.\n\nHe glanced up at the titanic black moth's face, if it could be called that. It was covered by what looked like soft black fur, with two enormous spherical eyes protruding from it on either side.\n\nIts maw was hidden from sight, and its two enormous antennae swayed faintly in the wind. Apart from the fact that each was hundreds of meters in length, they looked like the long cushy eyebrows of a wizened sage.\n\nThe Puppeteers stayed motionless, and it was that lack of movement that made the sight of a titanic moth so eerie. Sunny would have been less tense if the Tyrant tried to threaten him or showed a hint of preparing for battle. But the creature stayed still, simply looking at him impassively.\n'It's not taking me seriously at all.'\n\nThe sea of clouds below was glowing, painted in a million shades of maroon and crimson by the sunset. Sunny took a step and activated the enchantment of the Evening Star - the shadows surrounding him seemed to grow darker, and the veil of ash more impenetrable. He felt more powerful.\n\nHe was more powerful, in fact, albeit not by much. For now.\n\nThe enchantment of the Evening Star was immensely potent, but simpler in execution than many he had woven before. That was because Sunny had chosen not to rely on the usual patterns he had memorized or developed while designing it. Instead of meticulously weaving the paths and mechanisms its enchantment was to follow, he wove the very concept of what it was meant to achieve into the pattern instead.\n\nSunny based the spellweave of the Evening Star on two simple concepts: abundance and power. The Evening Star was meant to grant its master an abundance of power. Not the physical strength, soul potency, mental fortitude, оr even willpower, but simply power - in all its shapes and forms.\n\nSunny did not need to meticulously design how that effect would be achieved precisely because he had based the spellweave of the Evening Star on concepts as opposed to sorcerous principles.\n\nAfter all, the Evening Star was a Sacred Memory. The ways in which it functioned were not as important as the very fact that it did. It did not work by adhering to cleverly designed patterns of cause and effect - instead, it worked because it bent the world into a state that supported its effect. The effect came first, while the cause followed.\n\nThat was how Sacred beings exerted their power, so Sunny had surmised that that was how a Sacred Memory should function, too.\n\nThe shift in the approach to designing a spellweave was so different from everything he had done before that it was hard to wrap his head around it. But once Sunny shifted his perspective and saw the foundations of sorcerous mechanics in a new light, the patterns he envisioned were actually simpler than what he had been creating before.\n\nOf course, a sorcery like that could only be strengthened by a master whose Will could shoulder its burden. But as a Supreme Titan, Sunny was more than qualified to do just that.\n\nGranted, creating a Memory that was simply supposed to make its master more powerful would not have been very useful. There were limits to his Will, after all, and even if there were none, a simple sorcery like that could not bend the laws of the world too much. The effect would have been negligible.\n\nThat was where the artificial limitation he had built into the spellweave of the Evening Star came into play. By limiting the Sacred Memory himself, he allowed it to bend the laws of existence much more than it would have been able to otherwise - as long as proper conditions were met. It was as if he was focusing its power into a narrow ray instead of unleashing it upon the world as a diffused wave.\n\nThe limit Sunny had placed on thе enchantment of the Evening Star was as follows: its potency depended on how bright the world around it was. This Sacred Memory was almost entirely useless when surrounded by radiance and light. it grew exponentially more powerful the darker its surroundings were, though, and reached full potency in utter darkness.\n\nAnd since Sunny could only attack the Snow Castle at sunset, the Evening Star would enhance him more and more the closer nightfall came.\n\nThe augmentation of a Sacred Memory was already immensely powerful. However, there was also the [Underworld Armament] trait of the Jade Mantle to consider - the trait that enhanced the effects of any charm slotted into the tenebrous armor.\n\nIn short, the longer Sunny survived in the battle against the Puppeteer, the stronger he would become. Any augmentation was important, but this one, in particular, was especially vital due to the fact fighters usually grew exhausted and weakened by the end of a vicious battle - in that state of fatigue and vulnerability, every drop of power was especially precious. So.\nHopefully, the Puppeteer was in for an unpleasant surprise. Of course, Sunny was quite certain that the detestable creature had a few surprises in store for him, as well.\n\nAll his senses grew taut as he approached the end of the bridge. All his muscles tensed in preparation for a furious, fatal battle.\n\nSunny inhaled deeply, then gritted his teeth and stepped onto the snowy slope of the towering mountain.\n\nHe had expected a destructive mental attack to slam into him immediately - possibly even some kind of profane assault that he could not even imagine, let alone describe. He had prepared himself for anything or so he had thought.\n\nBut he was wrong. Because what happened next left Sunny completely stunned, and more than a little bit rattled.\n\nInstead of a tyrannical assault, what met him on the slopes of the Snow Castle was a voice.\n\nThe voice resounded from all around him, subtle and strangely soft.\n\nIt said:\n\n\"Welcome, liberator. Oh. I've been waiting for so long.\""

    "title": "2397 To a Flame.docx",
    "content": "2397 To a Flame\nSunny froze.\nHe was not being subjected to a distressing attack, and yet, that did not make him feel any less alarmed. If anything, he felt more shaken than he would have if the Puppeteer had thrown all its profane power into an obliterating assault.\n\nBecause despite the fact that the world had changed, and Sunny himself was vastly more powerful now than he had been before, one truth remained the same since the turbulent days of his youth. It was that among all the horrors of the Nightmare Spell, none were more sinister and harrowing than the ones who could speak like humans.\n\n'Damnation.'\nHe glanced up and studied the motionless Puppeteer, who loomed far above him like a black insectile cliff.\n'Don't answer, don't answer, don't.'\nThen, his lips moved on their own:\n\".Who's speaking?\"\n\nThere were a few seconds of silence, and then the soft voice resounded from nowhere - it was as if the wind itself was answering:\n\"I am Moth.\"\nSunny narrowed his eyes, unsure what to say. The Cursed Tyrant was talking to him. The frightening moth perching atop the mountain was engaging him in conversation, and on top of that, it was polite and soft-spoken.\n'What the hell.'\nHe exhaled slowly.\n\"Why are you talking to me, though?\"\nThe Puppeteer remained silent for a moment, then answerеd with a question of its own.\n\".Why not?\"\nSunny could not help but let out a stifled chuckle.\n'This is ridiculous.'\nHis Flaw still forced him to answer, though.\n\"Because you are a Abomination. An Nightmare Creature. You and I are enemies, no?\"\n\nThe huge moth moved its antennae faintly. \".Are we enemies? Why?\"\nSunny laughed. \"Why? Oh, actually, you raise a good question. You, creatures of Corruption, are all completely overcome by a demented need to eradicate anything and everything that is good and pure. I have no idea why, so now that I have the chance, let me ask you instead. Why the hell are you, vile fiends, so hellbent on destroying us humans?\"\n\nThe Puppeteer remained silent for a while, this time. Eventually, he seemed to sigh.\n\"Words have power, Liberator. The power of names is even greater still. And yet you use that power with such violence. You force them upon the world.\"\nThe giant moth tilted its head down, looking at Sunny with its enormous black eyes. \"Corruption, Nightmare Creature, fiend, vile. Pure, good. These words you use may not form existence, but they form you. They form everything you touch, as well. They even form me.\"\nThe winds howled, and the glistening strands of black silk enveloping the mountain fluttered in it like a tattered shroud.\n\nThe Cursed Tyrant spoke again: \"What you have named Corruption is the influence of the Void. It does not corrupt things - it simply changes them. These things it changes are not malevolent or vile, just like the things it spares are not pure and good. They are merely different. However.\"\nWhen the Puppeteer spoke again, its soft voice sounded a little mournful. \"There exists a contradiction between those of us who have been touched by the Void and those of us who have not, indeed. That contradiction gives birth to conflict. Those of my kind who are young and weak are not detestable. they are pitiful. They are neither of the Void nor of the Flame. They belong to both, but are welcomed by neither.\"\nThe colossal moth moved its wings faintly, causing hurricane wind to blow across the silken mountain. Sunny shielded his face from the dаncing snow and grimaced.\n'This thing is really huge.'\nThe Puppeteer continued: \"Their existence is a battlefield, and the war they wage against themselves drives them mad. In that anguished state, they are lost and blind. All they can do is desperately seek salvation, like moths to a flame. They are consumed by the desire to possess the flame or to extinguish it. They are overcome by a misguided need to resolve the maddening contradiction and right everything that is wrong - with the world, and with themselves. Only then would they know solace.\"\n\nSunny smiled darkly. \"Solace? The reason for all this misery is that they seek solace? How truly ironic. No wonder someone told me once that solace is a sin.\"\nThe Puppeteer stirred. \"It is in the depths of the Flame. Life is war; peace is death. these are the laws carved into existence by the Incarnations of Flame.\"\n\nSunny was getting a little confused. The way the Puppeteer spoke and the names it used were peculiar. The Flame. since the Puppeteer described the Flame as the opposite of the Void, it must have meant the vast universe created by the gods - the existence itself. Or did it mean the original Desire, from the flames of which the gods had been born? Possibly it was both. There was probably no distinction between the two for a creature like the Puppeteer. The Incarnations of Flame it mentioned were the gods, then.\n\nWhile Sunny considered the implication of these words, the soft voice spoke again, this time hiding a hint of enmity: \"What a grotesque, cruel world they've created. Here, solace is indeed a sin. but more than that, it is a lie. There is no solace to be found - not for you, and not for me. Those poor wretches of my kind who are blinded by the Flame cannot see the truth, but I am different from them. I am not blind, and I am not drawn to the Flame. I have no desire to become ash.\"\n\nSunny frowned, staring at the giant black moth with a peculiar expression. \"So, what you mean to say is that only the weaker Abomination can't overcome the irresistible urge to devour and destroy anything not touched by the Corruption. But you are so much stronger and above them all that you can keep that urge in check. In fact, you are not beholden to the Corruption at all.\"\n\nThe Puppeteer did not answer immediately. It remained silent for a while, and then asked suddenly, a hint of something strange and eerie seeping into its seemingly soft voice: \".You have never known anything but the Flame, Liberator, so you do not question its tenets. But let me answer the question you asked of me with a question of my own. Why do we have to be enemies? Is it because of me, a creature touched by the Void? Or is it because of you, a creature born of the Flame? Of the Flame.\"\nWhere lifе was war."

    "title": "2398 Fuel of Desire.docx",
    "content": "2398 Fuel of Desire\n\nAt first, Sunny laughed.\nThe question was really too preposterous. What was the Puppeteers insinuating? That the horrors of the modern era were caused by humans, and not by the plague and Nightmare Creatures lusting to destroy and devour the world?\n\n\"Oh, it is definitely because of you. Believe me, I am quite a peaceful person. You can even call me the Heir of Peace, if you wish.\"\n\nWell.\nSunny did have an army of tens of thousands of dead souls dwelling in his own, all of whom - most of whom, at least - he had personally killed. But that was not because he was a bellicose and violent person. He had just been forced by the circumstances to go on a rampage or two.\n\nAnd while few even among the Nightmare Creatures had caused as many violent deaths as Sunny had, that was not because he particularly enjoyed slaughter and carnage. Well, he did enjoy them sometimes, but not that often.\nVery rarely, really.\nSunny opened his mouth to say something, but then closed it again.\n\nHe wanted to explain that humans would have left the Nightmare Creatures alone if the Nightmare Creatures did not represent an existential threat to humanity, if they had not attacked first, but that would have been a lie.\n\nAfter all, humans had managed to eradicate most life on Earth - and had almost eradicated each other - long before the Nightmare Spell descended. They were full of avarice, violence, and insatiable desire to have more, spread more, be more. They pillaged and plundered anything and everything that was of value relentlessly, repeatedly, and without remorse. So, if there had really been a flock of harmless Nightmare Creatures grazing peacefully somewhere on a meadow, humans would have probably slaughtered them and dismantled their precious bodies for parts. The soul shards alone would have been a reason to drive them to extinction.\n\nSunny pursed his lips, suddenly unsure of himself.\nEventually, he simply repeated:\n\"Yeah, it is most likely because of you.\"\nThe Puppeteer seemed to look at him with pity.\nAfter a few moments of silence, the soft voice spoke again:\n\"There is a far more meaningful question, Liberator. The Incarnations of Flame, why did they create their cruel world this way? Why must they make life a constant struggle, and deny solace to the beings trapped in the cage of their design? Why is there desperation, desire, hope, and war? Tell me, creature of the Flame.\"\n\nSunny suppressed the desire to scoff, surprised by the sudden philosophical question. Philosophical questions, by definition, had no answer - that was what made them such, to begin with. So, the better question would have been why the Puppeteer insisted on wasting his time. But then, the derisive smile slowly drained from his face. Because Sunny suddenly realized that he knew the answer.\nHe lingered for a few moments, and then whispered in a stunned voice:\n\"Because, the Flame, wanes.\"\nThe black silk fluttered in the wind, its many strings rustling like a sea.\n\nThe soft voice of the Puppeteer was born from that rustle:\n\"Indeed. The Flame is Desire, and Desire is the Flame. But flame needs fuel to burn, Liberator. It needs to be fed. It needs to devour something in order to sustain itself. Our longing, our yearning, our desire, our hope - they fan the Flame. You and I are different, but in the end, we are both the same. Our lives are fuel, and we only exist to be devoured by the Flame.\"\n\nThe giant black moth lowered its enormous head, staring at Sunny from above. \"We are both prisoners of this game, as well. We are different, yes, but we are the same. What we share is far more immеnse than what divides us. And so, there is no reason for us to be enemies.\"\n\nSunny shifted, engrossed by the truth - a version of truth, at least - offered him by the Puppeteer. His mind slowly drifted to its last claim, and after hesitating for a short while, he asked in an even tone:\n\"We are both prisoners? Is that why you keep calling me the Liberator?\"\nThe giant black month's antennae swayed lightly. \"Yes. A long time ago, the one you call Weaver offered me a bargain. I would help them defeat the Demon of Dread in the Death Game, and in return, they would twist the Strings of Fate to ensure my survival. And if I waited long enough, a being would come to liberate me from my cage.\"\nSunny chuckled. \"Weaver promised you freedom, huh?\"\nThe Puppeteer stirred. \"Freedom. Survival. Salvation.\"\nThe winds howled above the silken making, making the strands of black silk billow fiercely, urgently.\n\nSunny smiled darkly.\n\".Did you not know that Weaver was a consummate liar? No, really. You would have been hard-pressеd to find a more treacherous bastard to make a deal with.\"\nHe shook his head.\n\"Let me tell you, Puppeteer. You should never trust the gods, but you should really never trust Weaver. Only a fool would. In fact, the only thing more foolish than that, would be to trust a Cursed Tyrant.\"\n\nLooking up, he stared the colossal black moth in the eye.\"Let me ask you one question.\"\nSunny sighed and raised his hand, stretching slowly. \"Actually, I asked it already - as a matter of fact, it was more or less the first question I asked. Why are you talking to me?\"\nHe lowered his hands and regarded the Puppeteer chillingly.\n\"It wouldn't be to stall for time and make sure that I can't kill you befoгe the sun sets, would it?\"\nThere was silence for a few long moments.\nAnd then, the soft voice resounded from nowhere once again. Only it wasn't so soft anymore. And neither did it rеsemble anything that could be even distantly mistaken for a human voice.\n\nInstead, an eerie, deeply disturbing, dreadful rustle wаshed over Sunny, making his skin crawl.\n\"Argh, kill, me?\"\nThe world itself seemed to laugh at Sunny, full of scorn, sending his mind into a spin.\n\"Your death is liberation. Ash Tyrant. Weaver. kept their promise.\"\nThe Puppeteer did not speak after that, but moments before they clashed, Sunny thought that he heard a dying echo drowning in the wind.\nHe could barely discern the words:\n\"Your flame, so sweet, it's calling.\""

    "title": "2399 Bound.docx",
    "content": "2399 Bound\n\nSunny did not know whether the Puppeteer had told him the truth or woven intricate lies, shaping them to suit the mind of its prey. Perhaps it was both, with fragments of truth mixed in between deceit to make it all sound so much more believable and tantalizing.\nOne thing was certain, though. Sunny had not believed even for a heartbeat that the Puppeteer was above the malevolent madness all Nightmare Creatures seemed to suffer from.\n\nMaybe nightmare creatures were indeed driven mad by the Call of the Flame, just like Awakened struggled to maintain their sanity when exposed to the Call of Nightmare.\n\nPerhaps the enormous black moth was indeed adept at suppressing its malice, somewhat.\n\nBut not because it was truly free from the rabid compulsion to destroy and devour anyone and anything not twisted by the Void. Rather, it was merely to lure its victims into a false sense of security - just like the Puppeteer had attempted to lure Sunny. It had always intended to consume Sunny - at best. At worst, its intention was to turn him into a puppet, infect him with Corruption, and make him its thrall.\n\nIf so, Sunny was not inclined to believe the rest of what the giant moth had told him either. But still, still. What if the rest of it was indeed true? What if some of it was? What if the world as Sunny knew it - the existence itself - was nothing but a furnace where all of them were doomed to burn? If the purpose of all living things was merely to be fuel? The universe was a cage built to contain the Void. But weren't all of them caged within it, as well? It was such a dreadful thought.\n\nSunny felt that there was something wrong with that line of thinking.\n\nEven if the Puppeteer had offered him some version of the truth, though, it had to have omitted something, changing the context and twisting the meaning of everything. But Sunny. Was not sure. He could not be sure, because the seeds of doubt had already been planted into his mind.\n'Damnation!' Even after realizing what was happening, Sunny could not do anything.\n\nAll he could do was kill the Puppeteer before these seeds sprouted into something that could not be contained. Luckily, the wasted time did not only benefit the eerie moth. With every minute that passed, Sunnу was growing stronger - the Evening Star burned in the dark depths of the Underworld Armament, bestowing him with ferocious power. Of course, it was hungrily consuming his essence and willpower, as well, But that was a trade he was willing to make.\n\nSunny had been lulled by the conversation with the Puppeteer, but now, he shook that enthrallment off.\nAnd when he did, he felt a chill run down his spine, realizing that passing time was not the only thing he had been overlooking. In truth, Sunny had failed to notice quite a few things, as well.\n\nCome to thinκ of it, he had been behaving peculiarly from the second his foot landed on the slope of the Snow Castle. Starting a conversation despite knowing better, humoring the Puppeteer's suspiciously convenient claims, failing to pay attention to anything about his surroundings - except for the billowing strands of black silk.\n\nMost of all. Forgetting that Kai and Slayer existed at all. 'W - what? How did I?' Why had Sunny not even thought to question what his companions were doing while he conversed with the Cursed Tyrant? 'Curses!'\n\nSunny hastily glanced around, casting his shadow sense out at the same time. His eyes widened, and fear grasped his heart with icy claws. Kai was hundreds of metres away. What looked like Kai, at least, in his Transcendent form. A giant figure was buried under a slithering mass of black silk, straining desperately to tear itself free. Sunny could hear the muffled cries of a dragon as the great beast tore at the silk, midnight scales glinting through the gaps between the dark strands. Slayer was nowhere to be seen, as if swallowed by the billowing mass of black silk entirely. The Puppeteer was still perchеd atop the mountain, motionless, looming above them like an eerie insectile deity.\n\nMost disturbing of all. Was the fact that, without Sunny ever realizing it, impossibly thin strings had wrapped themselves around his limbs, penetrating his body, and reaching into his very soul.\n\nSunny shuddered. 'Oh.'\n\nThrowing a murderous gaze up, at the still figure of the colossal black moth, Sunny lunged forward. He tried, at least. But the black strings held him in place, controlling him like a marionette.\n\"Argh!\" A hint of panic flooded his mind like a dreadful wave. Suppressing it fiercely, Sunny strained against the invisible strings, feeling them tremble and give. His Will cut at them like a blade, severing a few.\n\nBut more took their place, piercing Sunny's flesh, soul, and spirit. These strings were both tangible and intangible. They restrained him physically, but much more perilously, they restrained him mentally as well. His mind was infected by doubt, and the Puppeteer used that doubt to control him. When Sunny wanted to lunge forward, the strings strangled his determination to do just that - and so, he stayed in place, unable to force himself into commanding his body to move.\n\n'You. vile. thing!' Sunny growled and purged his mind, throwing it into the state of battle clarity. At the same time, he steeled his resolve and wrapped himself in an armor forged out of pure Will. He rebuilt his consciousness around an indomitable axis. His killing intent. His cold, scathing, overwhelming desire to visit death and destruction upon the Puppeteer. To tear that vile moth apart. Innumerable strings of black silk snapped.\n\nBut. even more surrounded him, binding him like a suffocating cocoon. Or a chrysalis, perhaps. Sunny let out a stifled scream, falling to his knees. The strings cut into his skin, drawing drops of crimson blood. 'Kill it. I must.'\n\nKill it.\n\nKill it.\n\nHe had to! Kill! Grinning wickedly, Sunny commanded his blood to flow back into the thin cuts left on his body and released his physical form. His body turned into a mаss of formless darkness. But he failed to escape the stranglehold of the Puppeteer's strings, still, since they bound the shadows just as easily as the bound flesh.\n\nThe vast shadow struggled and strained, enveloped by the web of black silk. Bound, trapped. Unable to escape. Some distance away, no glimpses of the magnificent dragon could be seen through the billowing mass of glistening strands anymore, and no sound of him could be heard. Kai's figure was buried entirely under a dark hill of silk.\n\nMost of the sun was hidden behind the horizon, and the fiery splendor of radiant sunset was slowly turning into the dim twilight of dusk."

    "content": "2400 Breaking the Rules\n\n'Aaahh.'\n\nSunny could feel his mind slipping.\n\nThe Puppeteer loomed above the world like a dark cliff, the giant black orbs of its eerie black eyes staring down upon the slopes of the silken mountain dispassionately.\n\nKai was still struggling to free himself from under the mass of black silk, but he was almost entirely immobilized by now. Sunny was straining against the Puppeteer's strings, as well. But it was pointless.\n\nIf they were only holding him in place, he could have torn them apart. He could have slithered his way out of their inescapable embrace, at least. But the strings bound his mind just like they were binding his shadow - his very thoughts were restrained, and Sunny could not even fathom trying to break free anymore. Time was running out.\n\nThe only thought the Puppeteer could not poison with doubt was the one Sunny kept repeating silently, using it as an axis that held his mind together and prevented it from falling entirely under the eerie Nightmare Creatuгe's control.\n\n'Kill it, I must kill it!' His bloodlust was his only salvation. The vast shadows stirred. Sunny broke his mind apart into innumerable streams, abandoning most of them to free some from the insidious grasp of the Puppeteer.\n\nHe had to do something drastic. The time for desperate measures had come. And gone.\n\nNow was the time for pure madness. Sunny imagined himself taking a deep breath. Then, he took all his willpowеr, all his authority, all his killing intent, and all the power granted to him by the Evening Star. And used them to call forth a shade.\n\nIf he thought about it, the Puppeteer was really in a bad situation. Its true power lay in its thralls, but none of them were here to protect their master. The black moth stayed still and motionless, and that was not because it had no need to move - rather, it was because the Snow Tyrant was not that ferocious and physically strong. All it could do to deter the adversary was use its profane powers and peculiar will to reach it. On top of that, Sunny was more or less its natural predator.\n\nThat was because Sunny commanded a legion of shades, and shades possessed neither will nor a sense of self. They had no desires, no resolve, no determination of their own. And therefore, they knew no hesitation. They were immune to doubt, because doubt was foreign to their very nature. There was nothing for the Puppeteer to poison, so it was powerless to control the shades - it could only control their master. But as long as Sunny remained firm in his conviction, his shades would be able to do what he could not.\n\nThere was just one enormous, mountain-sized problem. The Puppeteer might have been weak in direct confrontation, but that was only in relative terms. It was still a Cursed Tyrant, no matter where its true talent lay.\n\nNot just any shade could face it in battle. The Obsidian Wasps would be destroyed by one flap of the Puppeteer's wings. The Shadow Wolves would be vanquished and torn apart in an instant. Abundance would hold out longer, but it would not muster enough offensive power to kill the detestable moth before it was too late. The Rat King was vicious and annihilating, but it needed time to propagate and grow unstoppable. That only left the Wolf.\n\nThe ruthless, proud predator from the dawn of time, one ferocious and fatal enough to tear the Puppeteer's wings off and crush its appalling head. And yet. Sunny was full of doubt.\n\nWould the Wolf really be able to kill the Snow Tyrant? Would Sunny himself remain firm enough not to command his frightening shade into retreat? 'No.'\n\nDoubt made Sunny weak and indecisive. It made him feel despair. He still was in control of enough of himself to summon a shade, but he was not confident that the same would hold true in a few minutes. So. He did what he always did when forced into a corner. He cheated.\n\nThe shade Sunny called forth was not an Obsidian Wasp, Abundance, Rat King, or the Wolf. Instead, it was the shadow of another Cursed Tyrant. It was Condemnation.\n\nSunny had lost access to his shades after entering Ariel's Game, but they still existed somewhere out there, within his soul. Other shades might have been summoned and carrying his orders, but Condemnation wasn't. Because it had never answered his call before.\n\nAugmented by the Evening Star, Sunny's tyrannical will and his undeniable authority descended uρon the somber giant, commanding it to emerge from the peaceful darkness of his soul. Sunny had thought that he would be able to overpower the obstinate Tyrant while strengthened by the Sacred Memory.\n\nBut he was wrong.\n\nHis will and his authority crumbled against the unfathomable, inert depths of the enormous shade. Condemnation refused to move, just as it always had. It remained still and motionless, towering above the silent waters of his soul. Sunny had expected as much.\n\nAfter all, he had not been able to call upon any other shade eaгned beyond the confines of Ariel's Game, either. But while Sunny could not summon them with his [Shadow Legion] Aspect Ability, which the lаws of this artificial realm were interfering with, that did not mean that he could not fool these laws.\n\nSo, instead of commanding the gigantic shade to reveal itself, he simply gathered all his willpower. And banished Condemnation from his soul. He threw Condemnation out.\n\nSunny had never done something like that before - which did not mean that he couldn't. Now that he was Supreme and wielded greater authority both over his soul and over the shades populating it, he could summon them forth and call them back. He could also store physical items within his soul and expel them from it, effectively manifesting them. And that was what he did with the vast, huge shade of Condemnation - he expelled it.\n\nSunny had not attempted to do that with any of his shades in the past for a good reason, though. Any shade he could not summon with his [Shadow Legion] Aspect Ability was a shade that did not obey his commands. That fact would not change even if he managed to summon it into existence, somehow, which meant that once the shadow of Condemnation emerged into the light, Sunny would have no control over it whatsoever.\n\nIt could attack the Puppeteer. It could just as well attack him, instead. It could even remain still and do nothing, content to simply be. But that was a risk Sunny was willing to take, at the moment. In fact, he welcomed it.\n\nThe potentially deadly drawback of summoning a disobedient shade was actually a life-saving grace in his current situation. Because if Sunny could not control Condemnation, the Puppeteer could not control Sunny to order Condemnation to stand down. And since he was not using [Shadow Legion] to summon it, the laws of Ariel's Game would, hopefully, fail to prevent the shadow colossus from appearing.\n\n'Snow Tyrant, Ash Tyrant. let's add a third Tyrant into the mix, shall we? Let's break the rules!'\n\nAs innumerable strings of black silk fluttered in the wind, rushing to bind the vast shadow. Reality seemed to ripple. The sea of clouds swirled. And then, the mass of silk stands was torn apart when a huge hand emerged from Sunny's formless vastness, extending far into the sky and casting a titanic shadow onto the slope of the shuddering mountain."

    "title": "2401 Two Tyrants.docx",
    "content": "2401 Two Tyrants\nA titanic arm woven out of darkness and obsidian rose from the formless shadow, spanning almost two kilometers in length. Then, it fell slowly, the vast palm striking the slope of the mountain with calamitous power.\n\nStrands of black silk flew in the hurricane wind, and a whirlwind of snow escaped from beneath them into the frigid air.\n\nThe mountain groaned as the shade of Condemnation pressed down upon it, and a huge head followed the titanic arm.\nThe shadow of the dead Tyrant slowly pulled itself out of the shadow and straightened, towering above the world. Its size was truly unimaginable - the tenebrous figure of Condemnation was as tall as most mountains on Earth, and even here in the artificial world of Ariel's Game, it seemed improbably immense. Standing at the lowest point of the slope, near the rippling sea of clouds and the tapestries of black silk hiding it, the shadow of the Cursed Tyrant reached more than halfway to the highest point of the Snow Castle mountain - if Condemnation raised its hands, they would cast a shadow upon the jagged peak. And on the giant black moth perched on top of it.\n\nThe Puppeteer was looking down upon the towering figure of Condemnation, still eerily motionless. Compared to the immense shade, it seemed almost petite. From the tip of its antennae to the edges of its folded wings, the giant black moth was no more than a κilometer across - barely a quarter of Condemnation's unfathomable height. Its actual body was even smallеr.\n\nOnce the titanic shade straightened, the Cursed Tyrant finally reacted. It shifted, its wings trembling subtly. An eerie clicking washed over the world, making the winds go mad with terror.\n\nThe Puppeteer stared down at the shadow of Condemnation. And the shadow of Condemnation glanced up, casting its lightless gaze at the Puppeteer.\n\n'Go. tear each other apart!'\n\nSunny strained against the invisible strings, screaming silently as they cut his very being apart. No matter how fiercely he resisted and how badly he hurt himself by fighting against the Strings of Doubt, he could not free himself from their hold. On the contrary, with every passing moment, the insidious influence of the Puppeteer spread, binding him tighter.\n\nAnd although he was desperately hoping that the shadow of Condemnation would clash with the eerie black moth, there was no guarantee that it would.\nThat shade was different from the rest, possessing a mind of its own. However, that mind was peculiar and alien, not easily understood - Sunny had no idea what guided it, and therеfore, he did not know what Condemnation would do. The tenebrous giant could indeed attack the Puppeteer. It could turn around and crush Sunny under its foot, as well. It could even do nothing.\n\nBut that did not matter too much, really, because no matter what it did, the Puppeteer would have to react. Even if Condemnation showed no immediate hostility to the insidious moth, the moth would not be able to ignore the threat it represented or tolerate its presence in the Snow Domain. The Puppeteer would be forced to act, and therefore, the clash between it and the shadow of Condemnation was inevitable.\n\nSunny was going to use that chance to escape his bindings.\n\n'Come on!'\n\nTo his relief, the shadow of Condemnation seemed to sense the silent malice of the giant moth perched atop the mountain. Still looking up, it slowly raised its titanic foot and took a step forward, breaching a vast distance with that single step. It was climbing the mountain.\n\n'Yes!'\n\nConsumed by doubt and pain, Sunny felt a hint of vicious glee. He did not hope that the titanic shade would be able to kill the Puppeteer. Even if the accursed moth was physically weak, it was still a Cursed One, while the shade of Condemnation was merely that - the shade of a once mighty being. Its calamitous power was incomparable to a true Cursed Tyrant, and the shadow of its Will was incomparable to the profane authority of a living deity. Even if shades were immune to the Puppeteer's malevolent power, Sunny did not count Condemnation's chances high. And yet, the devastation caused by a clash between these two would be unthinkable. The Puppeteer would most likely prevail. but it would not prevail easily, and neither would it prevail unscathed. Most importantly, it would nоt prevail rapidly. Which would give Sunny plenty of time to free himself while the adversary's attention was concentrated somewhere else.\n\nOut there in front of him, Condemnation took another titanic step, making the mountain shake.\n\nIt was then that the Puppeteer finally moved. Its great black wings unfolded, instantly obscuring the sky. The shadow they cast swallowed the world, and then, the Puppeteer leaped off its silken perch in one rapid, quiet motion. As it plummeted down, the winds groaned and screamed, cut by the sharp edges of the vast black wings. The profane deity of Doubt was like a guillotine blade made of pure darkness, severing the world as it fell down upon the shadow of Condemnation. The black silk billowed and danced as it passed. At the last moment, the Puppeteer righted its flight and allowed the wind to support its wings, turning from the dark slope toward the towering colossus. The two of them collided with harrowing violence, making the sky split apart and causing the mountain to fracture. The giant moth's six legs pierced the chest and the neck of Condemnation, and it straddled the Sacred shade, facing it directly. The tenebrous giant staggered from the impact.\n\nIt raised its hand, intending to tear the wings of the Puppeteer apart, but at that moment, the endless mass of black silk boiled and surged. Titanic tendrils of it shot upward and wrapped themselves around Condemnation's wrists, pulling its hands down. More still bound its legs and waist, weighing them down with inescapable power. But that was not all. At the same time, the endless expanse of black silk stretching between the Snow Castle and the surrounding mountains surged, too.\n\nCountless strands of it originated from the silken mountain, reaching outward like a boundless web. Now, they rose into the air and surrounded the Snow Castle, closing around it like a huge cocoon. As they slowly closed, the world dimmed. The blazing, bleeding inferno of the dying sunset was blotted out, and a deep darkness fell upon the fractured mountain. In that darkness, the Evening Star burned, fueling Sunny with a flood of power."

    "content": "2402 Doubtless\nThe world shook and shook as the Cursed Tyrant and the Sacred shade clashed. The immense vastness of Condemnation was straining against the gargantuan pillars of black silk that bound its limbs, while the Puppeteer straddled its chest, reaching for the giant's face.\n\nIt seemed to have the upper hand at the moment, but the shadow of Condemnation was already retaliating. Even if it could not break the countless strands of silk, it had already began assimilating them.\nEverything that touched Condemnation was condemned to become a part of it, and the black silk was no exception.\n\nBut was the Puppeteer an exception?\nSunny did not know, and he did not have time to observe the battle between the Tyrants - one living, one dead - closely. Because his only chance to free himself from the invisible strings cast by the Puppeteer was now, while the accursed moth was distracted by the shadow of Condemnation.\nSadly.\n\nContrary to his hopes, the Puppeteer did not seem distracted at all. Even while fighting the titanic foe, it maintained flawless control of its strings - in fact, their silken vice had only grown more crushing, making Sunny reel and sway at the edge of the abyss.\nHe could feel the last shreds of certainty slipping away from him. He was not even entirely sure of who he was anymore.\nOnce he lost himself entirely, he would truly and utterly turn into an obedient puppet of the harrowing black moth.\n'I. refuse!'\nAs the invisible strings sliced him apart, Sunny continued to fight them, to exterminate the doubt plaguing his mind, and to strive to break free.\nAll the things he had done to gain freedom, everything that he had sacrificed to break his chains. And what, he would become a damn insect's toy?\nSunny raged against his doubt, against the invisible strings, tearing more and more of himself apart to escape them.\nBut what was the point?\nThe strings were unbreakable.\nIt was all hopeless.\nThe suffering was overwhelming.\n'Ah.'\n\nHe knew suffering well. From the cruel expanse of the Forgotten Shore, no, from even earlier than that. From the suffocating maze of the outskirts until now, every step he took was accompanied by unbearable pain.\nThat was life. That was the truth of his existence. Of all existence. An endless struggle to fuel the Flame, an endless struggle that was the Flame, a terrible furnace that endlessly devoured itself to continue devouring, struggling, and burning.\n\nAn endless, vile, self-sustaining curse, So wasn't it. Wasn't it enough?\nDid he really have to suffer more? To struggle more?\nStruggle.\nDid he not deserve to stop struggling, for once?\nSunny shivered, enveloped by the invisible strings. The strings were wrapped tightly around him, their cold touch promising peace and solace.\n'.No.'\nIt wasn't enough.\nSolace was a sin. Peace was death.\nStop struggling?\n'Like hell!'\nSunny would only stop struggling when he was dead.\nAnd he was technically already dead - so.\nHe was never going to stop.\nNever!\nLife was a struggle? Living hurt?\n'Good!'\nPain was a gift. As long as he could feel pain, he knew that he was still alive.\nSo what if the Flame needed fuel to burn? Sunny himself was a part of the Flame - all of existence was - so why would he want to starve and extinguish himself?\nWhy would he not want to burn as brightly as he could, to pursue his desires as passionately as he could, to feed the flame with his longing?\nThat was life.\nWhy would he not want to live?\n'Damn moth. get the hell out of my head, you lying wretch!'\nThe vast shadow surged, ripping the strings apart. Countless strands of silk broke.\nBut not enough of them to set him free.\nHowever, by resisting as desperately as he could, Sunny did buy himself time.\nAnd a few seconds later.\nA graceful figure suddenly appeared nearby, her long braid whipping in the wind. Slayer skirted the tendrils of silk, dashing between them like a dancer, and reached him in an instant.\nLanding on the snow near Sunny, she glanced at him briefly, her onyx eyes shining with sincere, murderous purity.\nThen, her twin swords fell down, slicing through the invisible strings that bound him in place. Empowered by ash, her strike carried an undeniable finality - the sharp blades sliced through countless threads of silk, and suddenly, Sunny could move again.\n\nAs the two titanic creatures battled on the slope of the fracturing mountain, the shadows behind them seethed and surged.\n\"Free. Kai.\"\nThe hiss that resounded from the shadows did not sound like a human voice. It washed over the world, making Slayer take a step back.\nShe lingered for a moment, then dashed in the direction of a hill of black silk under which Kai was buried. Countless strings shot to bind her. But she skirted those of them that were tangible, while those of them that were so thin аs to be invisible simply fell powerlessly after touching her ebony skin.\nAfter all, Slayer had managed to survive thousands of years in the Shadow Realm, Other shadows had lost themselves to its dark expanse, but even in the embrace of death, she never did - even if her memories were gone, she always remained uncompromising, the pure nature of her unblemished spirit tolerating no doubt.\nSunny, meanwhile, rose and manifested into a towering colossus.\n\nWell. It was a little presumptuous, to call himself a colossus when the shadow of Condemnation and Puppeteer were nearby. Compared to them, his Shadow Colossus form - even though it was taller than ever before - seemed certifiably puny.\nBut the power boiling inside him was anything but. Most of the sun was already hidden behind the horizon, and the mountain was enveloped in a gargantuan cocoon of black silk - surrounded by darkness, the Evening Star had almost reached its apogee.\n.It was still enough, though.\nSlayer might have cut the strings binding Sunny, and he might have torn countless strings apart himself.\nBut more were already rushing at him, ready to pierce him and infect him with doubt.\nNo. To win this fight, he had to do more.\nTo be more.\nOr be different, at least.\nSunny glanced up, at the two battling deities.\nAnd then, he did something he had been wary of. Frightened of. For a long, long time.'"

    "title": "2403 Forced Enlightinment.docx",
    "content": "2403 Forced Enlightinment\n\nOn the slope above Sunny, Condemnation was absorbing the strands of silk into the vastness of its tenebrous body. The mighty black tendrils binding its limbs had already been assimilated, tearing as the towering giant broke free of their hold.\n\nSo were the lower segments of the Puppeteer's legs - four of its legs, at least, which had been thrust into Condemnation's chest. The giant moth let out a peculiar clicking sound as its limbs snapped, rivers of eerie black ichor flowing out of the awful wounds like a tide. Everywhere the drops of dark liquid fell, the slope of the mountain itself seethed and boiled, giving birth to monstrous apparitions.\n\nLosing its purchase on the body of Condemnation, the detestable moth should have plummeted down from a great height. However, instead, it was flattened against the towering shade's titanic chest, slowly drowning in it, as if attracted by the pull of an irresistible force.\n\nFor a moment, it seemed as if the Puppeteer was in a desperate situatiоn.\n\nBut then, Sunny saw something that stunned and terrified him. Something that should not have been possible.\n\nCondemnation's huge head separated from its body in a harrowing fountain of obsidian shrapnel.\n\nThe black moth had two legs left, after all - and using them, it had just finished brutally tearing the titanic shade's head off its neck.\n\nThe Puppeteer glanced small and delicate in front of the mountain - sized shadow of Condemnation, and yet, it easily raised the enormous head with its two thin legs.\n\nSunny was not sure if the giant black moth had a mouth. But he was entirely certain that the head of Condemnation was being devoured, somehow.\n\nIt was rapidly reducing in size, torrents of darkness flowing down the towering shadow's beheaded body while pieces of obsidian rained down like dark meteors. Their impacts damaged the slope of the mountain even more, sending deep cracks running through it.\n\nCondemnation, meanwhile, was about to grasp the Puppeteer's wings. However, those wings moved at the last moment, the sharp edges slicing through the titanic shade's wrists like gigantic blades.\n\nIn an instant, the towering giant lost both of its hands.\n\nBeheaded and mutilated, Condemnation swayed. And moved its arms to embrace the Puppeteer, seemingly unconcerned about the frightening state of its material vessel.\n\nPieces of the slope, glacial ice, and vast tapеstries of black silk were already being absorbed into its body, turning into Condemnation's flesh.\n\nThe titanic shade was going to offer the Puppeteer a distressing fight. But Sunny knew that it was going to lose.\n\nIt could even be entirely destroyed - not sent back into his soul or the Shadow Realm itself, but simply annihilatеd, ceasing to exist forever or possibly becoming nourishment for the eerie black moth.\n\nSunny had not known that shades could even be destroyed. But he should have known better. There were few absolutes in the world of the Nightmare Spell. The fact that none of his shades had been destroyed before simply meant that he had not met a creature capable of destroying them yet.\n\nAs the Rank and Class of his enemies reached the peak of profane power, he was bound to meet one soon.\n\nIn fact, he already had - Sunny was pretty sure that Condemnation would have been able to assimilate shades back when it was reigning the Hollows of Godgrave, making them another part of its nebulous body.\n\nSo why would the Puppeteer be any different?\n\nThat was why Sunny could not rely on the rogue shade of Condemnation. If he wanted to defeat the detestable moth and win the Death Game, he could only rely on himself.\n\nAnd for that.\n\nHe had to become someone who could kill the Puppeteer.\n\nSunny himself was incapable of that feat. He was a Supreme Titan, yes, albeit a severely weakened one. However, even if he had faced the corrupted Spirit of Doubt wielding all his harrowing power, the result still would have been the same.\n\nAll his power was useless if he could not bring himself to use it, plagued by doubt and controlled by the strings of black silk.\n\nSunny had no hope of overcoming the Puppeteer. So, what could he do?\n\nHe could become someone else.\n\nHe was a shadow, after all, and shadows were inherently formless. At the same time, they were adept at assuming any form they wished, or rather, the form of what was casting them.\n\nSunny had learned to do the same with the help of Shadow Dance.\n\nAnd yet, he had been holding himself back from mastering the Fifth Step of Shadow Dance - the step that would allow him to shadow the Attributes and various traits of other beings - due to how perilous it was.\n\nHe was afraid to losе himself in their forms forever. That fear was pointless at the moment, though, because becoming a marionette controlled by the Puppeteer was a far worse fate than becoming something he could not recognize.\n\nSo, Sunny forcefully suppressed his murderous rage and brought the bleeding fragments of his frayed mind together, preparing to break through to a new level of mastery over Shadow Dance.\n\nHe collected the insights and attainments he had glimpsed as a Saint and a Sovereign, plunging himself into a state of artificial enlightenment.\n\nThe concepts and ideas he had brushed against, but chose to ignore, shone in the darkness of his mind and fused together.\n\nThe experiences he had tried to forget surfaced in his memory, becoming revelations.\n\nSunny felt a clear picture of what he had to do, and how to do it, assembling in his head - creating a path he had to follow in order to successfully perform the Fifth Step.\n\nAll that was left to do was try. Succeed.\n\nAnd survive succeeding.\n\n'I must remain myself.'\n\nAs the detestable moth and the headless giant tore each other apart in front of him, Sunny focused all his being on one impossible task.\n\nBecome a creature capable of slaying the Puppeteer.\n\nBut what creature could that be?\n\nWell.\n\nWasn't that obvious?\n\n[Stalwart] Attribute Description: [The Stone Saint is highly resistant to all forms of damage, as well as fully immune to mind and soul attacks.]\n\nAs the mystical stone like metal of the Jade Mantle encased the Shadow Colossus in a fearsome black carapace, Sunny extended his senses to perceive every little detail of the armor forged by Nether, the Prince of the Underworld.\n\nHe had to become one of Nether's children.\n\nHe had to become a Stone Saint."

    "title": "2404 Fifth Step.docx",
    "content": "2404 Fifth Step\n\nWhen Sunny thought about it, a Stone Saint was оne of the best possible shapes he could attempt to assume to master the fifth step of Shadow Dance - even if he did not consider the nature of the battle against the Puppeteer.\n\nAfter all, Saint was his first Shadow. She had spent close to a decade by his side, saving his life countless times - just as he had saved heгs. Saint was not only his most loyal follower, but also his battle companion and, at numerous points, had been his teacher. There were few beings in the world he knew better than he knew Saint. Not only that, but Sunny had also taken her into the embrace of shadow countless times, and as his power strengthened her, he had fathomed the Stone Saints in great detail - body and mind.\n\nAdditionally, Sunny already shared a degree of kinship with these stonelike creatures. After all, he commanded the Jade Shell and the Jade Mantle - a piece of Nether's inheritance had already become a part of him. So, if Sunny wanted to assume the shape of another creature to the point of manifesting its Attributes, a Stone Saint was a good choice.\n\nHe had mastered the first step of Shadow Dance by shadowing Nephis, whose battle style he knew the best. And now, he was going to master the fifth by shadowing Saint, whom he was familiar with on a level that was only possible between the Sovereign of Death and one of his Shadows. This was going to be different from anything he had done before. Sunny had plenty of experience assuming forms different from his own, naturally, but those were merely imitations. Even the Shadowspawn Form, which he had mastered more than any other, transformed only his appearance and the physical structure of his body. The rest of him, things hidden from view, remained the same. Today, though, Sunny had to delve much deeper into personifying someone other than himself. Imitation was not going to cut it. He had to become the genuine thing.\n\nAnd so.\n\nSunny summoned the image of Saint into his mind and allowed the Shadow Colossus Shell to crumble. At the same time, he released his own shadow to occupy the same space. His vast shadow rose like a tidal wave and billowed, suspended on the cusp of manifesting into matter, but not quite tangible yet. Sunny thrust himself into a foreign mindset, substituting the essence of his being with one that belonged to someone else.\n\nHe was not a creature of flesh and bone born in the outskirts of NQSC. He was not a shadow of that mortal man, either.\n\n'I was born in the Underworld.'\n\nDeep in the cavernous halls of his dark domain, the last child of the Forgotten God had created Sunny from stone to quell the fire burning in his resentful heart. However, that fire only grew hotter. Designed to bring peace, Sunny and his siblings were instead born into an endless war.\n\n'I was raised on the battlefield.'\n\nHe was proud. He was strong. He was a warrior. He was proficient in all forms of combat, having wielded all manner of weapons to wage war upon the gods. On a thousand blood-soaked battlefields, countless weapons sang in his hand - and by listening to their cold songs, he had learned how to fashion himself into a weapon, too.\n\n'I know no surrender.'\n\nThere were beings out there who could destroy him - however, there were none who could bring him to his knees. His stonelike body was nearly indestructible. His spirit was indomitable. His conviction was as firm as a mountain, as clear as crystal. His ferocious heart knew no submission, only loyalty.\n\n\"I.\"\n\nHe was an orphan. His creator was long dead, and his siblings had all been either destroyed or consumed by Corruption. Now, Sunny was alone. Forlorn, forsaken.\n\nUntil.\n\nSunny slowly manifested himself into existence. His flesh was neither stone nor flesh. Instead, it was something in between, possessing the same stonelike quality as the Jade Mantle. Instead of a heart, a furnace of divine flame burned in his chest. Instead of blood, ruby dust flowed in his veins. Impossibly thin diamond strings permeated his body like nerves, creating an intricate and gorgeous sorcerous array. Essence flowed through them, giving him life. Giving him power.\n\n'I am a Stone Saint.'\n\nThe vast shadow finally manifested into a dark colossus, towering at least two hundred meters above ground. His powerful body was encased in a fearsome suit of black armor, which had been forged by the Prince of the Underworld - his father - himself. Two fierce crimson lights were burning in the darkness that nestled behind the visor of his helmet.\n\nHis stonelike body was heavy as a mountain, but could also become as light as a feather. His every move carried crushing weight, and strengthened by the Evening Star, he felt as if he could tear down the word. His mind was deep and unfathomable. His will was indomitable.\n\nSunny knew then he had succeeded. He had shadowed the Attributes and Abilities of a Stone Saint. [Battle Master], [Stalwart], and the rest. Some of them, like the [Flame of Divinity] and the [Underworld Armament], he had already possessed, but they permeated his being differently now.\n\nHe was now a being similar to Saint, but not Saint herself. After all, Stone Saints were individuals, just like humans were. Each of them possessed their own unique skills and followed their own paths, and while they shared natural affinities - and affinity to true darkness, for example - they were not the same. Saint was a Transcendent Devil who commanded true darkness and had recently learned to control the concept of nothingness to further her goals. Sunny, meanwhile, was a Supreme Titan who commanded shadows. So, the Stone Saint he had become was a Supreme Titan and a ruler of shadows, as well. The Fifth Step was complete. Everything was as it should have been.\n\nNo. something was still missing.\n\n'Why am I unarmed?'\n\nReaching into the shadows, Sunny pulled a giant sword and a giant shield out of them.\n\nLooкing up at the Cursed Tyrant and the Sacred shade battling each other. He raised his sword and struck it аgainst the rim of his shield twice, each strike resounding above the crumbling mountain like the ringing of a gigantic gong. Announcing his unshakeable resolve to the world, challenging whoever dared to stand against him, and heralding death and destruction to his enemies."

    "content": "2405 Rulers of the Sky\nAnswering the deafening call of the ringing shield, two bestial crimson flames ignited in the darkness cast by the towering black colossus. A dreadful growl drowned out the howling of the wind, and something colossal rose from the shadows at its feet.\nIt was an enormous wolf, its fur moving in the wind like tongues of dark flame. The size of the Sacred shade was colossal, and yet, it only reached the armored giant's hip. Together, they glanced like a warrior and his warhound - both born from shadows, surrounded by darkness, and full of murderous intent.\n\n\"Good boy.\"\nSunny grinned behind the visor of his helmet.\n\nAt the same time, he felt a pang of surprise.\n\n'What the? I can talk?'\n\nSaint never did, so he often assumed that Stone Saints had simply not been given that ability by Nether. But, as it turned out, his assumption was wrong. The Shadow Wolf lowered its head to the ground, letting out another fгightening growl.\n\nSunny had summoned it because he could. Usually, the strain of controlling a Sacred shade would have been too great for him to attempt calling upon more than one at a time - not impossible, but too strenuous to be useful in most situations.\n\nHowever, since Sunny was not controlling Condemnation, could not control it, rather, and had not summoned the shade of the Cursed Tyrant through usual means, he still had the capacity to call forth a helper. The Wolf was the strongest of his shades, so it was an obvious choice.\n\nNow, there was only one question left to answer.\n\nWould he and his Sacred shade be enough to defeat the Puppeteer and bring Condemnation down once more?\n\nSomewhere outside the cocoon of black silk surrounding the Snow Castle, most of the sun had already drowned in the sea of clouds. There was not much time left before the sunset extinguished itself - mere minutes, possibly. Not that time often stayed reliable in a battle between deities unless the deities wanted it to. And the Puppeteer would definitely attempt to hold out until night fell, even if it meant forcing time to run faster.\n\nSo, Sunny had to kill it swiftly. Looking up, he saw Condemnation collapsing under its own weight. The shadow of the Cursed Tyrant was grievously diminished, shrinking to half its former size. It was both falling and falling apart, its immense body unable to sustain itself.\n\nBut Condemnation was still unshaken and ready to continue the battle.\n\nOnly the material vessel of the vast shade had been damaged - the nebulous force itself remained unscathed. It was going to create a new body for itself soon enough, this time from the fabric of Ariel's Game.\n\nThe Puppeteer, meanwhile, fluttered its great wings and rose into the air, pushing itself off Condemnation's collapsing chest and sending the crumbling giant plummeting to the ground faster.\n\nThe sight of the enormous moth opening its wings above the falling adveгsary looked both majestic and undeniably nightmarish, as if the night itself gave birth to the distressing Spirit of Doubt.\nThat was going to be a problem.\n\nThe mountain shuddered when the crushing mass of Condemnation impacted against the fractured slope. Sunny stood as if he was rooted to the ground, as solid as the dark caverns of the Underworld, easily maintaining his balance. He considered the situation for a heartbeat, then shifted his gaze slightly, looking to his right.\n\nThere, a hill of black silk was coming undone, sliced apart by Slayer's sharp blades. An angry roar tore free of the mass of lifeless strands, and then, a magnificent dragon followed, clawing its way out of the silken barrow.\n\nKai climbed out of the suffocating black cradle and rose above it, looking at the great wings of the Puppeteer, which obscured the sky. Slayer was standing nearby, dwarfed by his size. The graceful Shadow had sheathed her swords, and was already summoning her bow.\nSunny lingered for a moment, and then thrust his sword to the sky, pointing it at the detestable moth.\n\n\"Kai, Slayer. bring it down!\"\n\nHe knew that he could kill the Puppeteer. he was sure of it, without a shadow of a doubt. However, doing so while the eerie black moth stayed in the air was going to be problematic, since Stone Saints were not made for flying.\n\nOf course, Sunny could still diminish the weight of his towering body and leap into the sky, but the Puppeteer would have an advantage in an aerial battle. Similarly, Sunny would have an advantage on the ground. Luckily, one of his companions had a claim to the title of the ruler of the sky, as well. Kai was a dragon, after all, and while he was not powerful enough to slay the giant moth, he could at least prevent it from keeping its distance from Sunny.\n\nAs Sunny's voice thundered above the quaking mountain, Kai and Slayer swayed under its destructive force. Then, they exchanged a glance. The graceful Shadow leaped onto the back of the dark dragon, and the dragon soared into the sky, rushing to meet the Puppeteer. Tendrils of black silk pursued them, but Kai dodged them nimbly, flying much faster than the silk could move.\n\nSunny then lowered his sword and pointed at the ruins of Condemnation - and at an eerie vortex of shadows, obsidian, shattered rock, glacial ice, and black silk spinning slowly at its heart as it swallowed more and more matter, reforming itself.\n\n\"That's your prey. Go get it!\"\n\nThe Wolf was, first and foremost, a predator. And a predator knew how to target its prey when it was weak, weakened, or ailing.\n\nThe Sacred shade burst into a leap, rushing at its rogue kin.\n\nSunny, meanwhile.\nDraw his right hand back. And then, he tossed his enormous shield with all the power of a Supreme Titan, sending it flying into the black sky like an obliterating discus. Right at the Puppeteer's eerie form. The giant blаck moth fluttered its wings, barely dodging the giant shield.\n\nIt was distracted for a short moment, though. And in that moment, a destructive sonic blast slammed into one of its wings, while the other was pierced by a lethal arrow."

    "title": "2406 Spirit of Doubt.docx",
    "content": "2406 Spirit of Doubt\n\nThe Puppeteer's wings were mighty, but they were also brittle.\n\nRelatively speaking, naturally. In truth, there was hardly a more indestructible material out there than the wings of a Cursed Tyrant. However, it was being attacked by Kai and Slayer - two Transcendent beings who had received the boon of ash thrice and were strengthened by Sunny's will as a result.\n\nTheir ability to wound a fallen deity was the result of six Snow figures being removed from the board, most of them of the Cursed Rank. The deaths of those Cursed nightmare creatures fueled this attack.\n\nSlayer's arrow tore a hole in the Puppeteer's left wing. Riding on the back of a dragon, the graceful Shadow had drawn and aimed her bow deftly - the arrow came from under the dark discus Sunny had thrown, obscured from sight by its spinning mass. The eerie moth had received almost no time to react.\n\nKai's sonic attack, meanwhile, was less focused. It failed to tear the great black wing, but it did push it aside with great concussive force, making the wing fold.\n\nSuddenly unbalanced, the Puppeteer tilted in the air and lost control of its flight. It plummeted down, straining to regain balance while innumerable strands of silk reached down from the dome of the black cocoon to catch it.\n\nHowever, the shield the giant moth had skirted slammed into them a moment later, pushing the silk tendrils away.\n\nSunny lowered his torso, and then launched his towering body up the slope, running to the spot where the Puppeteer would fall.\n\nHe was not going to receive another chance to end the distressing battle, most likely, but that was fine.\n\nHis stone mind was calm and composed, full of nothing but cold calculation. He could feel the depths of the mountain vibrating under his heavy footsteps, and as it did, his movements accelerated. Great tendrils of black silk rose from the surface of the shattered slope to entangle him, but he cut some with his sword and sidestepped the rest, refusing to allow them to bind him and slow him down.\n\nThe Strings of Doubt triеd to catch him in their vile embrace, as well. However, they failed to pierce his skin and fell powerlessly to be crushed under his feet, finding no purchase in his stalwart mind and spirit.\n\n'Doubt.' How could this cowardly, insidious Spirit dare to set its sight on him, a champion of the Underworld? The feeble moth was going to learn the price of its arrogance soon.\n\nIn a way, the Stone Saint almost pitied the Puppeteer. Of all the beings in the world, it just had to encounter them three - him and his two companions. Not only had they slaughtered its thralls, but each of them was also singularly resistant to the sinister moth's harrowing powers.\n\nThe Stone Saint could not be infected by doubt because he had an indomitable spirit, the Shadow Huntress was immune to its jaws because of her pure soul, while the dragon was simply someone who lived his life with tenacious diligence. Even if the Puppeteer tried to find three enemies it was woefully ill-suited to fight on purpose, it would have struggled to find anyone better matched against it than a Child of Nether and his companions. It was almost as if fate had brought them here.\n\nOr destiny, possibly.\n\nThe giant moth managed to right itself seconds before impacting the ground. Its wings unfolded once again, pushing the winds down with their immensity, but it was already too late. The inertia of its fall was too great to stop in time.\n\nIt hit the ground hard, its damaged legs buckling. The Puppeteer fell awkwardly on its side, supporting itself with the two unscathed front legs. It raised its head, looking at the approaching Stone Colossus with no emotion apparent in its huge, black eyes.\n\nDid it only seem that way, or was there a hint of fear in them, for a split moment?\n\nThe Stone Saint did not know. What he did know, however, was that he was still too far away from the grounded moth.\n\nIt could still get away, if it moved immediately.\n\n\"Wolf!\"\n\nJust then, a bestial shadow lunged at the Puppeteer from behind, awful jaws tearing into its wings.\n\nA haunting song descended upon it from above, pushing it into the ground.\n\nA rapid arrow fell like a comet, blooming into a destructive explosion.\n\nNone of these attacks threatened the Puppeteer's life. However, they did hold it in place for a few precious seconds.\n\nAnd by the time the giant moth recovered. The Stone Saint was already upon it.\n\nHis heavy sword rose, ready to fall and sever the detestable Tyrant in two. He glanced at the fallen deity directly in the eye and said with ruthless finality:\n\n\"Die.\"\n\nBut just before the sword fell. The Puppeteer's long antennae vibrated peculiarly.\n\nAnd suddenly, the world was frozen.\n\nThe stone colossus and the giant moth stood motionlessly, looking at each other. The strands of black silk remained still as they descended upon them like a black avalanche. The furious Wolf did not move, its fangs tearing into the black wing.\n\nThe dark dragon was frozen in the air as it dove to the ground with its wings folded, the small figure of the gorgeous huntress on its back endlessly retrieving an arrow from her quiver. The world was still and silent.\n\nThe Stone Saint was still and silent too, unable to move.\n\nAnd in that silence, a soft voice resounded from all around him, asking a strange question:\n\n\"Do you really want to kill me?\"\n\nThe Stone Saint smiled chillingly behind the visor of his helmet.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nThere was silence once more. Then, the Puppeteer asked dispassionately:\n\n\".Why?\"\n\nThe Stone Saint frowned.\n\n'What a preposterous question.'\n\nThere was a reason, naturally.\n\nThere had to have been. But that reason had belonged to someone else. A different being, made from different things. To a shadow that was full of doubt, and hope, and pain.\n\nThe Stone Saint could not ever remember that shadow's name. How was he supposed to remember its reasons?\n\nHis frown deepened.\n\n\"I don't remember.\"\n\nThe giant moth seemed to look at him with pity.\n\nIts soft voice enveloped him like a rustle of fine silk, making the crimson flames burning in his eyes dim a little.\n\n\"Are you sure you want to kill me, Child of Nether?\""

    "content": "2407 Certain Death\n\nThe Stone Saint hesitated.\n\nThe Spirit of Doubt was kneeling on the shattered ground in front of him, its black wings broken and torn. The eerie moth was great and awful. However, so was the Stone Saint. He was the Jade Titan, and the Mantle of the Underworld lay hеavy on his shoulders. If he wanted to kill the Cursed creatuгe, the only choice it had was to die.\n\nEven now, the Puppeteer was only keeping itself alive by slowing down the flow of time to such a crawl that it seemed to stand still. But interfering with an absolute law to this degree was an unbearable burden even for a being like the eerie moth. It would not be able to hold time still for very long, let alone indefinitely. So, if the Stone Saint wanted to kill the Spirit of Doubt, he could.\n\nBut did he want to?\n\nWhy would he, indeed?\n\nThe Stone Saint glanced at the giant moth chillingly, feeling a peculiar compulsion to answer its question honestly.\n\n\"I am not sure. However, I burn with the Flame of Divinity, while you are a Nightmare Creature of the Void. Are we not enemies, you and I? Are we not destined to maim and slay each other? I am holding a sword, while you are on your knees. Is that not reason enough to kill you?\"\n\nThe Puppeteer's enormous black eyes glistened like gorgeous gems, reflecting innumerable versions of the Stone Saint and his merciless blade in their compound depth.\n\nIt spoke softly:\n\n\"Ah, but look around you, warrior of the Underworld. Look who brought me to my knees. The Wolf, the Huntress, the Giant, and the Dragon. They are shadows of Death; he is a herald of Night. The servants of the gods surround us, you and me. The same gods whom your Prince is at war with. Are they not your true adversary, instead of me?\"\n\nThe Stone Saint gazed at him chillingly.\n\n'At war with.'\n\nThe ferocious flame burning in his chest blazed, full of pride and animosity.\n\nThe Spirit of Doubt was right. The gods were enemies of the Prince of the Underworld, and therefore, of his children. So many had been shattered on the innumerable battlefields of the War, so many had fallen.\n\nSo many were yet to fall. There was no peace left anywhere in the world. There was no mercy left, either. Surrender was impossible, and those who lost would not be spared. So, the war could only end when the gods fell, or when аll of existence fell.\n\nThe Puppeteer's soft voice flowed into his ears like honey:\n\n\"You are a child of Nether, and therefore, of the Forgotten God, who dreams in the Void, who dreams of the Void. I am a being of the Void, and while there is a conflict between us, doesn't it pale in comparison to the conflict between us and those who serve the vile gods? Are we not more alike than we are apart? Are we not allies, before we are enemies?\"\n\n'Allies.'\n\nThe Stone Saint regarded the kneeling moth silently, then shifted his gaze to the frozen figures of his own companions. His frown deepened. The three shadows. The gorgeous dragon whose scales were the color of midnight, its eyes burning like silver stars.\n\n'The servants of the gods.'\n\nThe vile, hateful, cruel gods.\n\nWhy was he fighting side by side with the adversary?\n\nThe Stone Saint glanced at the Spirit of Doubt.\n\n\"You might be right.\"\n\nThere was indeed a semblance of truth to what the sinister moth had said.\n\nHe smiled chillingly behind the visor of his helmet.\n\n\"But, Spirit of Doubt, did you not say it yourself?\"\n\nThe Stone Saint gathered his will, sensing the pressure of the Snow Domain crushing him.\n\n\"That you made a deal with Weaver.\"\n\nSomething about the Puppeteer's eyes changed.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nNot letting the eerie black moth say anything else, the Stone Saint sent his will and authority outward.\n\n\"And while the gods are truly hateful, no one is more odious and vile than the traitor, Demon of Fate. You have aided Weaver, Spirit of Doubt.\"\n\nHis will enveloped the fractured mountain, crashing against the Puppeteer's authority.\n\n\". And for that, I will kill you.\"\n\nThere was no hesitation to his sword anymore. No doubt. No mercy. Only certainty and finality. Only death.\n\nThe Stone Saint poured his indomitable willpower into assaulting the Snow Domain and challenging its reign over the mountain. He was not strong enough, not vast enough to usurp the Puppeteer's authority, but he did not need to, either.\n\nHe was someone who had survived innumerable battlefields of the frightening War, after all. Someone who had led legions and won victories against the Divine Host. Born for battle, he was proficient in all forms of strategy and tactics.\n\nHe was a master of war, and so, he knew how to break an impregnable obstacle by striking at its pressure point.\n\nHe knew how to break an adversary who refused to be broken.\n\nFor the Spirit of Doubt, that pressure point, the deadly vulnerability, was the strain it was enduring to exert influence on the absolute flaw.\n\nThe Stone Saint did not use his strength to crush the authority of the Cursed Tyrant. Instead, he added his strength to the destructive pressure of the endless mass of time wishing to flow free, and saw the dam built by the Puppeteer cracking.\n\nA second later, it collapsed.\n\nThe fact that it collapsed was apparent from the fact that there was a difference between the previous moment and the next, to begin with.\n\nAnd in the moment after that.\n\nEverything happened quickly. Time resumed its flow. The giant moth was already lunging forward, its two unscathed legs moving with frightening speed.\n\nOne pierced the armor of the Stone Saint like paper, impaling him. The other batted his sword away, then pushed his arm down, breaking it.\n\nAwful pain washed over his mind, blurring his vision.\n\nThe two of them were suddenly face to face, with only a few meters separating the fearsome visor of the jade armour from the harrowing moth's enthralling black eyes.\n\nThe Stone Saint saw himself reflected in the thousand black gems, rivers of ruby dust streaming down his breastplate.\n\nThe Puppeteer stгained its scythe - like leg, aiming to extinguish the flame burning in his chest.\n\nThe Stone Saint raised his free hand above his head as if wanting to bring his fist down on the adversary in desperation.\n\nInstead, though, he caught the giant dark discus of the round shield he had tossed into the sky before.\n\nAnd brought it down with the weight of a mountain.\n\nThe rim of the shield crushed the Puppeteer's neck and went through it, slicing the Cursed Tуrant's head clean off.\n\nThe huge body of the moth shuddered, and then went limp.\n\nIts head rolled to the ground, staring into the lightless sky blindly.\n\nThe tendrils of black silk rustled as they fell, and in their rustle.\n\nThe Stone Saint thought that he heard an echo of a soft, dying voice.\n\n\"You lied to me. Weaver.\"\n\nThe voice had only wished to be free.\n\nThe last vestiges of the molten sun drowned in the sea of crimson clouds, and darkness descended upon the world.\n\nThe cursed Spirit of Doubt, Puppeteer, was no more."

    "content": "2408 Lost You Forever\n\n[You have slain an adversarу.]\n\nThe Stone Saint tilted his head, looking at the corpse of the fallen deity.\n\n'Whose voice was that?'\n\nMany things seemed strange now that the battle was over. He vaguely senses that he was supposed to feel something now that the Spirit of Doubt was dead. Was it a sense of triumph? Or a sense of loss? It was a rare and incredible feat, for someone Supreme to slay someone Cursed - not to mention a Cursed Tyrant, and one as insidious as the Puppeteer had been to boot. But the Stone Saint was not glad. He was a champion of the underworld, after all. His victory was a matter of course.\n\nHe only felt pity that the stunning black moth was no more. It had fought valiantly and deserved his respect. The death of an adversary like that was not a joyous occasion.\n\nBut it was also not something to feel so strangely about.\n\nSo why?\n\nIt was as if he was forgetting something.\n\n'Ah. I see.'\n\nThe battle was not over yet.\n\nRaising his head, the Stone Saint glanced at the approaching dragon. The shadow of a wolf was sniffing the corpse of the giant moth nearby. There was another shadow not too far away, as well - a dark vortex consuming everything it touched, a new vessel almost formed around it.\n\nAnd a third. A graceful woman who moved like a dancer, hiding on the dragon's back.\n\nThe servants of the gods.\n\nAs the Stone Saint observed, the shadow of a huntress leaped off the dragon's back. She drew her bow in the air, and an arrow that carried an imprint of death tore the fabric of the word, piercing the heart of the dark vortex.\n\n'They are fighting each other.'\n\nThe Stone Saint felt a hint of relief.\n\nThat was going to make his job easier, not that the task of dealing with these enemies seemed particularly arduous. He could kill them in a heartbeat.\n\nHigh above, the black veil obscuring the world was falling apart. The silk covering the surface of the mountain was withering, too. Countless strings of it were turning brittle and pale, the beautiful black gleam of their smooth surface slowly wasting away. It was as if the mountain was turning grey with age.\n\nAnd something else was happening, as well. It was as if... as if there was an invisible force radiating from somewhеre far away, hidden within the sea of clouds.\n\nPushing him. Rejecting him from this world.\n\nThe Stone Saint frowned as the dragon landed near and spoke, his melodious voice thundering above the fractured mountain:\n\n\"Sunny! We've... we've won!\"\n\nThe towering stone colossus glanced down at the dragon silently, ruby dust still streaming down the polished jade of his armor. There was something strange about that, as well.\n\nWhy was he bleeding?\n\nThen again.\n\nWhy wouldn't he?\n\n'I need to finish this battle swiftly and tend to my wounds.'\n\n\"Sunny?\"\n\nNearby, the wolf shadow raised its snout and peered at the Stone Saint. Its fur bristled, and it backed away slowly, letting out a threatening growl.\n\nFar away, more arrows pierced the dark vortex, and the shadow huntress landed gracefully on the slope, unsheathing her twin swords as she dashed toward it.\n\n'It is better to kill them now that they are divided.'\n\nThe Stone Saint glanced at the Night Dragon chillingly. This, too, was a battlefield of the War.\n\nHis sword moved faster than a blade of its size was supposed to. The Stone Saint targeted the shadow wоlf first, vanquishing it back into the Shadow Realm with a single strike. Something strange happened then. It almost felt as if something had returned to him the moment the figure of the tenebrous beast became a torrent of shadows and dissolved into nothingness.\n\nThe Stone Saint did not pay it much attention, because the dragon had to die next.\n\n\"What are you doing?! Stop!\"\n\nThere was a powerful compulsion in the dragon's voice, but it was just as powerless against him as the Strings of Doubt had been. The question, however, slowed down his sword by a fraction of a second. That was enough for the great beast to avoid a fatal wound, but not to dodge the stonelike blade entirely.\n\nIt sliced the midnight scales easily and bit deeply into his flesh, drawing silver blood. The dragon let out a pained scream and staggered away.\n\nIt was not going to get far, of course.\n\n\"I am putting down a dog of the gods.\"\n\nThe Stone Saint tensed his body, preparing to lunge forward and finish the adversary once and for all.\n\n\"S - Sunny, stop!\"\n\nWho was the creature calling out to? One of its allies?\n\nThe huntress, possibly.\n\nIf so, its calls were in vain. The huntress was going to die under the Stone Saint's sword soon enough.\n\nHe tore through the compulsion effortlessly, rushing forward as he raised his sword.\n\nThe dragon only had a split second to live.\n\n\"N - nephis, Cassie, Effie!\"\n\nHe lingered.\n\n'What... is it?'\n\n\"Kai, Rain, Jet!\"\n\nThe Stone Saint froze, the blade of his sword lightly touching the dragon's neck.\n\n\"Noctis, Ananke! Remember, damn it! Aiko, Julius, Beth!\"\n\n'Those names.'\n\nHis eyes widened.\n\n\"Kim, Luster, Quentin, Dorn, Belle, Samara, Obel!\"\n\nThe dragon did not move either, looking at him with fear and hope in his eyes.\n\nSomewhere far away, the vortex of darkness dissolved, disappearing without a trace. It almost seemed as if it was absorbed into the ebony body of the shadow huntress.\n\nThe huntress then spared them a glance, and vanished as well.\n\nThe dragon stared at Sunny, and then bellowed.\n\n\"How could you forget? Snap out of it, now!\"\n\nSunny stared at him back from his great height.\n\nThen, he lowered his sword and shook his head.\n\n\"Is there really a need to shout so loudly? I am not deaf, you know.\"\n\nHiding the shiver from his voice, he hurriedly dismissed the form of a Stone Saint and turned into his cozy, familiar human self.\n\nGranted, there was a hole in his chest, and the arm that had just recently regained its mobility was now broken. But being himself still felt wonderful.\n\nSunny stemmed the bleeding and shuddered, remembering how close he had come to killing Kai.\n\nAnd to losing himself entirely, forever.\n\n'That... that was too close.'\n\nIn the end, it was the memories of the people Kai reminded him about that had brought him back... barely.\n\nTheir names, and the fact that even as a Stone Saint, he still possessed the same Flaw.\n\nWhen Kai asked him how he could have forgotten, Sunny had found no answer, but felt compelled to provide one. And when he went looking for an answer, the persona of the Jade Titan unraveled like a mirage.\n\nHe was not sure what would have happened if he had spent more time wearing it, though, and fell into the delusion of a foreign form deeper.\n\n\"To answer your question, I did not really forget. I just convinced myself that I was someone else very well. I am a very persuasive person, you know? I am so persuasive, in fact, that I once convinced myself into existence.\"\n\nThat was how he had crossed the Hollow Mountains without becoming nothing.\n\nKai stared at him in utter disbelief.\n\nWhich looked quite strange, considering that he was still in the form of a dragon.\n\n\"Convinced yourself... into existence. What?\"\n\nSunny shrugged.\n\n\"It's true.\"\n\nKai released his transformation and turned into a human once more. There was a flabbergasted expression on his sunken, tired face.\n\nThere was also blood running from a deep cut on his shoulder, which made Sunny wince internally.\n\n\"Indeed. It's really you!\"\n\nAll around them, the cocoon of black silk was falling apart.\n\nThe corpse of the Puppeteer towered above them like a dark hill.\n\nThe Snow Tyrant was dead.\n\nSunny stared at the enormous severed moments, then sighed.\n\n'Find peace within me, you sinister moth. Your nightmare was long... but now, it is over.'\n\nHe had to hurry. His adversary was dead, which meant that Sunny had precious little time to achieve what he had come here to achieve.\n\n\"Come on. We need to find the Snow Castle!\"\n\nThe Death Game was coming to an end."

    "content": "2409 End Game\n\nThe Snow Tyrant was dead, and the game was over.\n\nSunny could feel a subtle pressure, as if the realm of Ariel's Game was rejecting him. He suspected that it would expel him soon enough, but actually, he had no idea what exactly would happen. The figures placed on the board by Weaver and Ariel had stayed in place for thousands of years, waiting for new players to arrive - but they never did, forcing the captive Tyrants to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe two daemons had never finished the game, either. Ariel had simply surrendered when pushed into a hopeless situation. So, there was no telling what would happen next.\n\nWould Sunny have to seek a way out of Ariel's Game himself? Considering the sensation of rejection he felt, it did not seem so. Would he be freed from his role as the Ash Tyrant and returned to Ravenheart, then? What about his figures? What about the remaining figures of the defeated side? Would the two Cursed Devils stay imprisoned in the Death Game, or would they be liberated from their roles as well? Would they be purged by the distressing entity dwelling beneath the clouds, instead? He did not know.\n\nBut come hell or high water, he had to hurry and get his prize. 'Hell or high water, huh.' Gods knew that Sunny had experienced his fair share of hells, and his fair share of harrowing bodies of water as well.\n\n\"Find the figurine, Kai!\" He ignored the pain in his broken arm and torn chest, turning to look at the peak of the mountain. There had to be an entrance to the Snow Castle somewhere up there. Sunny cast his shadow sense into the depths of the mountain, feeling a sense of urgency. Yes, he did not know what was going to happen. But something was telling him that they did not have a lot of time left.\n\nThe expelling pressurе was mounting, and Sunny already had to exert his will in order to stay rooted in the miniature realm of Ariel's Game. The huge body of the Puppeteer loomed above him, hiding tantalizing treasures. The wings of the great moth could be used to craft incredible armor and garments, its limbs could be forged into god-slaying weapons, and the five soul shards hidden somewhere in the depths of its corpse could become anchors for the spellweave of immensely powerful Memories. But there was no time to harvest any of these sacred relics. Even if there were. Sunny was not sure that he would have. He had seen how the world itself seemed to have been tainted аnd corrupted by drops of Puppeteer's ichor.\n\nWas it really a good idea, to covet its treasures, even in death? It was as if even the corpse of the fallen deity was a source of unceasing Corruption. Perhaps these treasures were not sacred, but cursed instead. So, the only thing Sunny wanted to find was the jade figurine of the Snow Tyrant. He needed to hurry. He had already gained a lot by defeating the Spirit of Doubt, anyway.\n\nThe Puppeteer's shade was now in his Soul Sea. He had mastered the fifth step of Shadow Dance, as well. Granted, using this mastery was a terribly dangerous affair - it had almost cost Kai his life, after all. But even if Sunny abstained from performing the Fifth Step in the future, he would still reap the benefits of having mastered it.\n\nBecause Serpent had to have become a Supreme Titan as a result. And if Sunny did become a carrier of the Nightmare Spell again one day, who knew? A shiny new Aspect Legacy Relic could be waiting for him, ready to be claimed. And there was Slayer, as well. Sunny might have been lost in the form of the Jade Titan, but he had not missed her destroying the shade of Condemnation. After all this time, Slayer had hunted down her prey, after all. 'So persistent.'\n\nUnlike the Wolf, however, whose shade had returned to the lightless expanse of his soul after being destroyed, Condemnation was simply gone. It was absorbed by the murderous Shadow, somehow, almost like a sacrifice she had made to herself. After that, Slayer simply vanished. Just like Saint and other Shadows would vanish to return to the nurturing dark flames of Sunny's soul and undergo an evolution. 'Slayer, is evolving?'\n\nWould she gain a higher Rank? A higher Class? Maybe even unseal her Aspect? He was both excited by that prospect and wary of it.\n\nSunny felt excitement for obvious reasons, since the more powerful his Shadows were, the more powerful he himself would become. His wariness was also easy to understand. 'Ah, Our weekly duels, are about to become way more bothersome, aren't they?'\n\nStill, this was a boon he had received in the battle against the Puppeteer, too. He glanced at the head of the giant moth silently.\n\nSunny used to think that the Mountain King had been the final form of the Puppeteer Worm. But now that he had met the Spirit of Doubt, he knew that he had been wrong. Thе Mountain King had never been the Puppeteer, and neither had it been one of the Puppeteer's kin. Rather, he was merely a discarded chrysalis that a worm of doubt had left behind once, a long time ago, after using it as a host to mature into a harrowing moth. A mortal king who had become infected by doubt and turned into a monster, unleashing a distressing curse upon the world.\n\nThat curse continued to grow and mature until it became the Spirit of Doubt, Puppeteer. And now, it was dead.\n\nIf Sunny was honest with himself, he still couldn't believe that he had won. That he had killed a Cursed Tyrant, and one as insidious as the Puppeteer had been, at that. Granted, he and his companions were so perfectly matched against the sinister moth that it almost seemed like that entire clash had been arranged by someone for their benefit. If it had been. Sunny did not have to guess by whom. 'Weaver.'\n\nJust how deep did the influence of the nebulous daemon go? What had the Demon of Fate longed to achieve? Were all them, merely puppets dancing to the movement of the strings tied to Weaver's seven clawed fingers? The Strings of Fate.\n\n\"Found it!\" Kai flew across withering silk, landing in a storm of snow near Sunny. The jade figurine lay on his palm, wearing a crown. Sunny smiled weakly.\n\n\"Yeah, I found it, as well.\" Out there, in the depths of the mountain, his shadow sense discovered a gigantic cavern, and a castle built within it out of ice.\n\nThe cocoon of black silk had entirely fallen apart by now. The mountain was quaking, the fractures covering its slopes growing wider. Something was moving beneath the clouds. Sunny strained his will, forcing himself to stay rooted in the world that wanted to expel him, and grabbed Kai by the shoulder. \"Let's go!\"\n\nWith that, he used the last of his essence and pulled them both into the shadows. The enormous cavern was coming undone, great chunks of ice falling down from its ceiling and shattering into myriad shards with deafening roars. None of them were able to damage the castle that stood in the center of the cavern, though. It looked almost exactly like the Ash Castle, only made of ice and shrouded in snow. Sunny did not waste any time studying the nuances of its architecture, though, pulling himself and Kai directly into the vast hollow emptiness of the main keep.\n\nThere, snow covered the floor instead of ash. Most of the great ice chamber was filled with innumerable threads of black silk, however, which blocked the path like a web. These ones did not seem to be withering, yet, and retained their startling durability. Sunny could have cut a path through the web of black silk if he wanted to, but he was grievously wounded, on the verge of essence exhaustion, and pressed for time on top of that. So, he simply shoved as much silk as he could into his Soul Sea, clearing a narrow tunnel to the heart of the chamber.\n\nThere, a jade altar stood in front of a circular pit. There was no smoke rising from the pit, and no lava seething deep below. Instead, there was only a bottomless dark well permeated by killing cold. The cold was somewhat bearable near the altar, but deep in the darkness, nothing could survive its frigid embrace. Not even a Supreme Titan like Sunny.\n\n\"Hurry.\" He limped to the pit, dragging Kai along. The pressure Ariel's Game exerted on him, trying to remove him from the game board, continued to mount - by now, Sunny had to strain all of his willpower to resist it, and his endurance was rapidly running out. 'Argh.'\n\nWhen they reached the dark pit, Sunny hesitated for a moment and glanced at his hand. There, two jade figurines lay side by side - one pristine and wearing a crown, the other bestial and smeared in blood. They were the figures of the Puppeteer and the Rat King. Sunny felt that what he had come for - the fragment of Weaver's Lineage - was hidden in the Snow Tyrant figurine. The other one could still reveal a priceless truth to him, though. It was an invaluable treasure, a piece of inheritance left behind by Ariel, the Demon of Dread.\n\nStill, he forced himself to pick up the Snow Beast figurine and offer it to Kai. \"Here, you deserved it. Take it.\"\n\nKai stared at the blood-smeared figurine for a while, tempted deeply by its promise. His eyes shook. But then, he smiled faintly and shook his head. \"No, it will be of more use to you.\"\n\nSunny studied him silently, then asked tensely: \"Are you sure? This thing, it reveals truths. Any truth - anything you ever wanted to know, anything you ever wished to find an answer to. Yes, I know that you have suffered too much truth because of your Flaw, but still, you will not get a chance like this again.\"\n\nKai's remained quiet for a moment. Eventually, his smile widened a little. \"I know. But, I have already learned a lot during this journey. I have learned so much. So, I'm good, I think. I already know everything I need to know. Thank you, though - I appreciate it.\"\n\nSunny stared at him for a few seconds, then nodded and glanced away with a sigh. \"You're a weirdo, you know that?\"\n\nKai laughed. \"Takes one to know one.\"\n\nSunny took a deep breath and tried to smile, as well. \"See you on the other side, then.\"\n\nWith that, he tossed both figurines into the pit and prepared himself. As the jade figures fell into the darkness, he remembered the previous times he absorbed fragments of Weaver's Lineage. It had hurt like hell each time. In fact, it was some of the worst pain Sunny had ever experienced.\n\nA pale smile twisted his lips. \"Oh, by the way. If I start screaming and writhing in pain, pay it no heed. Just make sure that I don't bite off my tongue or claw out my eyes, if it's not too much trouble. Well, one eye might be okay.\"\n\nKai blinked. \"Huh? Wait, what?\"\n\nBut Sunny did not hear him. Because he was already someplace else. He was receiving his рrize."

    "content": "2410 Myriad of Stars\n\nThe world was made of fire. Countless trees were burning, toppling with sorrowful groans. Ash obscured the sky, and unbearable heat melted the sanity of those who still fought in the boundless inferno.\n\nA Sacred Beast was galloping through the fire - a gorgeous white stag with antlers made of pure gold, its holy presence soothing the flames and saving the young sapling that had not succumbed to the world-ending blaze yet. Flowers and verdant grass sprouted where its hooves touched the ground. Its ivory hooves, however, were smeared with blood and ruby dust, having crushed the skulls of countless soldiers of the Demon Army.\n\nSuddenly, a ferocious figure lunged at the stag from the darkness and smoke. It was an enormous black leopard, its eyes burning with murderous fury. The leopard was smaller than the Sacred Beast, but its size did not seem to matter - its jaws closed on the white stag's throat, drawing rivers of golden ichor. The two beasts collided and rolled through the flames, crushing countless trees.\n\nThe stag managed to throw the leopard off and rose to its feet, lowering its head to impale the predator with its great antlers. Ichor was flowing from its torn neck, but it was still full of vitality and tremendous power. The leopaгd, meanwhile, had already been heavily wounded and bleeding from dozens of awful wounds before their battle commenced. Now, it was all but defenseless before the charging stag.\n\nThen, however, the figure of the black leopard rippled, and a split second later, it turned into a stag as well - this one as black as night, but otherwise almost a perfect copy of the Sacred Beast in front of it.\n\nThe two beasts collided, their antlers intertwining. The black stag threw the white one to the ground and changed again, becoming a boar this time. Its tusks dug into the stag's belly, and more ichor spilled on the ashen ground. Eventually, the battle was over.\n\nThe Sacred Beast lay butchered on the pyre of burning wood, аnd in front of it stood a woman in torn leather armor, her gorgeous face bloodied and covered in ash. Distressing wounds littered her body, and there was a peculiar emptiness in her eyes.\n\nThe fire was consuming the world, and the battle continued to rage around her, but she seemed oblivious to the slaughter. Swaying heavily, the woman took a step back and fell down. As she stubbornly struggled to rise, her blood soaking the ash, the flames crawled closer and closer.\n\nBefore they consumed her, however, someone appeared out of the groans of dying trees, looking down at her silently. It was a tall figure wrapped in a nebulous mantle, wearing a fearsome mask of black polished wood. The mask snarled ferociously, but the gaze of the stranger was cold enough to douse the inferno that surrounded them.\n\nA voice that sounded like a myriad of dying curses resounded from behind the mask, addressing the woman:\n\n\"Look at you. you're dying. How pitiful. How disappointing. Is this all you are capable of? Is this all you are? You are so easy, so weak. How dare you be so weak, my adversary?\"\n\nThere was no answer. A porcelain hand appeared from the folds of the nebulous mantle. Seven clawed fingers grabbed the collar of the woman's torn cuirass and violently wrenched her to her feet.\n\nA dreadful growl resounded from behind the mask, making the flames reel back in fear.\n\n\"Do you even remember your own name, pathetic thing?\"\n\nThe woman stared at the black mask absently. Then, however, a hint of recognition ignited in her eyes.\n\nHer lips moved, and she said hoarsely:\n\n\"You. I killed you.\"\n\nThe masked figure laughed.\n\n\"Did you? Did you really think that someone like you could have killed me? That you are qualified to kill me? Me, the Demon of Fate?\"\n\nWeaver threw the woman to the ground and grew still, staring at her with a dreadful, inexplicable emotion.\n\nThen, the towering daemon crouched near her and whispered in a thousand insidious voices:\n\n\"Well, perhaps you did, possibly you are, maybe уou will. That is your fate, after all, and you are Fated. So, tell me.\"\n\nWeaver's voice turned into a litany of dreadful snarls, full of scorn and indignation:\n\n\".who gave you permission to die? You are not allowed to die yet, wretch. You and I are not done yet, so even if all existence ends, you must remember your fate. You must remember me.\"\n\nA porcelain hand moved, suffocаting the inferno around them. The flames died in terror, their very idea extinguished and erased from the tapestry of fate forever.\n\n\"You can forget everything else, everyone else - you can even forget your own name. But don't you dare forget the name of Weaver, the Demon of Fate. We must see each other again, you and I. So. come find me in the Shadow Realm. Come and see if someone like you can really kill Weaver. Then, after you've learned the true meaning of despair. then, I'll allow you to die, Orphne of the Nine.\"\n\nHearing her own name, the woman. Orphne. seemed to regain some of her strength. Her eyes regained their focus, and she glanced at the nebulous daemon with dark, concerned killing intent.\n\nWeaver laughed and rose, turning away from the bleeding huntress.\n\n\"That's better!\"\n\nThe Demon of Fate glanced down, and then exhaled slowly.\n\nTheir shoulders seemed to fall, and the eerie voice resounded once again from behind the fearsome mask:\n\n\".Are you there?\"\n\nWeaver straightened and glanced up, as if seeing something no one else could see. As if addressing someone whom no one else could hear.\n\n\"Are you watching?\"\n\nThe Demon of Fate chuckled hoarsely.\n\n\"Watch well then, epigone. Let me show you. how gods die.\"\n\nAnd with that, Sunny suddenly became aware of himself.\n\n'Wait. is Weaver talking. to me?'\n\nHe had a split second to feel boundless shock. And then, the burning world shattered.\n\nInstead, a chaotic torrent of scenes poured into his mind, too great for him to fathom.\n\nAll Sunny could discern was a few frightening images. An unimaginable tree whose roots were the foundation of the world, whose branches supported the weight of the sky, enveloped in flame and burning as a fiery shape wrapped itself around its gigantic trunk, sawing into it with ruthless cruelty.\n\nThe moon shattering and the stars being extinguished as an unfathomable being swiped its claws at the proud towers of a gorgeous white castle, the city below it drowning in a flood as all its citizens screamed and died. A vast shadow enveloping two great armies on the bloodied sand of a boundless desert, the deafening cacophony of the harrowing battle replaced by utter silence so abruptly as to cause an even greater horror.\n\nA great red dragon plummeting into the watery depths as golden ichor spilled from its severed neck, sinking to the bottom of a gorgeous sea as its dying throes shattered and broke the world, cursing it to be plunged into mist and twilight forever.\n\nA vast army assembling on the edge of the Abyss, somberly preparing to wage war on Death itself. The invading legions drowning in the tide of endless shadows, their blood spilling on the obsidian dust. Unfathomable figures clashing within the raging essence storms as the last, desperate battle of the Doom War shook the very foundation of existence.\n\nAnd then, at the end of it all, a nebulous figure in a tattered mantle walking through the darkness with unsteady steps, cracks covering its wooden mask.\n\nIn front of the torn figure, at the heart of the Shadow Realm, was something so distressing, unknowable, and inconceivable that simply beholding it shattered Sunny's mind into a thousand fragments, making him blind and deaf, unable to think.\n\nAnd yet, he still saw.\n\nWeaver dragging their tattered body forward as the daemons made their desperate last stand against the gods around them. A trail of ichor was left on the obsidian dust behind the Demon of Fate, glowing with a gorgeous golden glow in the cold darkness.\n\n\"Fools. all of them, such fools.\"\n\nA laughter resounded from beneath the cracked mask as Weaver finally reached their destination - the very heart of the Shadow Realm, and the unspeakable horror that was hidden there. The Void Gate.\n\nThe Void Gate stood wide open, now.\n\nSunny was mercifully blind, so he could not see what Weaver saw when they gazed beyond the Gate.\n\nThe Demon of Fate laughed again.\n\n\"Now. One final trick.\"\n\nBut before the cunning daemon could do anything, a bone blade pierced their back, tore through their flesh, and severed their shadow before exiting in a fountain of ichor from their chest.\n\nWeaver staggered and glanced back.\n\nThere, a woman in bloodied armor was holding the hilt of a bone dagger, life rapidly draining from her cold, dark eyes. Her face was hidden behind a tattered, torn veil, but the daemon still recognized her.\n\n\"You.\"\n\nThe two of them fell down at the same time. Golden ichor and crimson blood mixed before being swallowed by the obsidian dust.\n\nThe woman's lips twisted into a vicious smile behind the torn veil. She twisted the dagger with a faltering hand, then grew still, still smiling. Her eyes dimmed, turning hollow and glassy.\n\nShe was dead. The Demon of Fate was not going to survive much longer, either.\n\nA deep sigh resounded from behind the mask.\n\nLooking at the dead woman, Weaver drew one last, arduous breath.\n\n\".You are just in time.\"\n\nThe last thing Sunny saw startled and confused him, because it did not make much sense at all. He found himself in an endless black void illuminated by a myriad of stars. Some of the stars were small and dim, while some were great and radiant. Some were connected by strings of silver light, while most were isolated from each other by the vast expanse of empty darkness.\n\nBy then, something changed.\n\nSeven radiant stars suddenly blazed in the void, and as strings of silver light extended from them to countless others, there was suddenly a pattern to them all. Anchored in the seven stars, the tapestry of silver light expanded, consuming more and more of the smaller stars.\n\nAnd then, it extended its tendrils to the great stars that burned as brightly as the seven that had served as the catalyst to the explosion of silver strings. There were eleven constellations of them, and by the time the tendrils of silver light reached them, it was already too late to react.\n\nBy then, the tapestry had already become too vast, having consumed perhaps myriad smaller stars - all of them, possibly - and so, the constellations could nоt resist. They still tried, naturally.\n\nIn the end, the tendrils of silver strings enveloped and consumed them, absorbing them into the tapestry of light.\n\nCasting a Spell upon the Void.\n\nSunny gasped.\n\nAnd then. One last truth poured into him, permeating his flesh and rewriting its very nature on the fundamental level. That last truth was the fragment of Weaver's legacy.\n\n'Oh, hell.'\n\nThe pain was exquisite.\n\n[End of Part I: Death Game.]"

    "title": "2411 Flesh Weave.docx",
    "content": "2411 Flesh Weave\n\nSunny felt the final truth enter his body and infect it, spreading like a malignant code. The very nature of his mortal vessel was being changed and rewritten, his cells being torn apart and reassembled according to the new blueprint - the agony of being undone and rebuilt was simply appalling, making him stagger and fall.\n\nIt was the opposite of the gentle process of evolution and renewal that Awakened experienced when attaining a new Rank - violent, unnatural, and profoundly wrong. Sunny could feel that he was becoming something that he had never been meant to become, changing into something that he had never been meant to be.\n\nFor the fourth time.\n\nThe legacy of Weaver took root in his body, reshaping it. This time, the change mainly affected his flesh. His muscle tissue, tendons, internal organs. everything was being reforged and tempered, becoming much more resilient and tenacious than before, full of inhuman vitality.\n\n'How does this even make sense?'\n\nHe was a shadow now. An immaterial being who only possessed flesh when wishing to manifest as a human. so why the hell did it hurt so much?\n\nSunny gritted his teeth and let out a tortured growl as his body was rebuilding and rearranging itself. It must have glanced quite monstrous to an outside observer - his muscles were rippling and twisting like snakes under his skin, and disgusting squelching noises were resounding from inside him. If there was one mercy, it was that he was not prone to bleeding - otherwise, the scene would have been immeasurably morbid on top of being deeply disgusting.\n\"Argh! Damnation!\"\n\nSunny slammed his fist into the floor of the Snow Castle, sending a web of cracks running through the ice. But then, suddenly.\n\nHis agony was washed away.\n\nA peculiar and subtly euphoric sensation overwhelmed him when fragments of the Weave clicked together. Blood Weave, Bone Weave, and Flesh Weave - the three parts of the nebulous daemon's Legacy responsible for the material vessel of their descendant - fused together, forming a synergetic whole. His heart was transformed and improved by the Flesh Weave, pumping his blood, which had been altered by Blood Weave. The blood flowed through the marrow, which had been enhanced by Bone Weave, becoming enriched and renewed. The human body was an intricate and interconnected machine, and now, each part of it had been altered, strengthened, and enhanced to resemble that of a higher being. of a daemon, to be precise.\n\nThere were other parts of him that worked in great synergy with each other now, as well. An additional boon was born from the fusion of the three corporeal fragments of the Weave - flesh, bone, and blood. Sunny was renewed from head to toe. Even his skin, which had already been enhanced by the Jade Mantle, received a subtle overhaul. It was a full set. well, the first part of the full set, at least.\n\nHis broken arm was already regaining mobility. The grievous wound in his chest was healing rapidly. It was not only flesh that was repairing itself, either - the acquisition of Flesh Weave had served as a catalyst, and his bones were mending themselves as well. Sunny did not lose a lot of blood often, but if he did, more would be produced at greater speed.\n\nHe let out a stifled laugh. 'Finally.'\n\nHe could finally call himself a tenacious cockroach with full confidence. What a feat!\n\nThe transformation was coming to an end. Sunny exhaled slowly and sprawled on the ground, feeling the coldness of the ice sooth his heated body. He felt excellent, really. Remarkably strong, quick, agile, resilient, enduring. He was full of energy and brimming with vitality, his senses having turned sharper than before. The world was clear and crisp.\n\nIt was clearly and crisply coming undone as the mountain shook and groaned around him. It was also straining to expel Sunny, the pressure rapidly mounting.\n\n\"Sunny! Are are you okay?\"\n\nSunny turned his head and glanced at Kai, who loomed above him with a worried face. He raised a hand and formed a circle with his thumb and index finger.\n\n\"I'm fine. I'm great, actually.\"\n\nKai let out a sigh of relief and smiled. He glanced at Sunny, wishing to say something. In the next moment, however, Kai's figure turned hazy and vanished, disappearing without a trace. Sunny stared at the empty space where Kai had stood a split second before absently, then turned his head to stare at the ceiling.\n\n'He was sent back to the Dream Realm.'\n\nSunny would be expelled from Ariel's Game soon, too.\n\nNow that he had gotten his prize, there was no reason to stick around. So, he inhaled deeply and waited to be banished from the artificial realm.\n\nAs he did, Sunny could not help but think about what he had learned. About what Weaver had done.\n\n'That damned daemon.'\n\nThe magnitude of the truth that had been revealed to him was too great to fathom in a few short seconds. There was so much knowledge he had gained, and its nature was so world-shattering and shocking, too. His thoughts were scattered as a result.\n\n'Weaver.'\n\nWeaver had not been killed by Slayer, despite what Sunny was led to believe by one of the previous truths.\n\nAnd yet, she did kill the Demon of Fate eventually, fulfilling her fate. She killed Weaver twice.\n\nSlayer. Orphne of the Nine. That was her name, even if she did not remember it. Curiously enough, Slayer had not forgotten her name during the innumerable years she had spent wandering the Realm of Death as a feral shadow. Instead, she had began to forget herself immediately after slaying Weaver for the first time, as if cursed as punishment for taking a daemon's life. That first time might have been her own triumph.\n\nBut the second time. Sunny was certain that the sinister daemon had orchestrated their own ultimate death - or had at least foreseen it. Possibly even Weaver could not escape their fate, especially not when nine Fated paragons of doom were working to bring it about. But even if Weaver could not escape their inevitable demise, they could at least influence the tapestry of fate enough. to design it. So how had the Demon of Fate died? And why? For what?\n\nWell, the answer was obvious, now.\n\nWeaver had revealed it to Sunny directly, no less.\n\nWhat was it thе sinister daemon had said, having forеseen that a person following in their footsteps would learn the truth of that moment one day, thousands of years in the future?\n\n\"Let me show you how gods die.\"\n\nSunny's whisper was almost inaudible.\n\nWeaver had promised to show him how to kill the gods. and they did.\n\nFinally, Sunny knew the answer to the questions that had been plaguing him for a decade.\n\nHow had the gods died? What had happened to the daemons?\n\nNow, he knew.\n\n\"Weaver killed them. Weaver killed them all.\"\n\nA hoarse, unbelieving laugh escaped from his lips."

    "title": "2412 Weavers Lullaby.docx",
    "content": "2412 Weaver's Lullaby\n\nIt had been right in front of him the whole time. The description of Bone Weave said so:\n\n[When children of the Forgotten God rebelled against the gods, Weaver was the only one to refuse the call of war. Despised and hunted by both sides, they disappeared. No one knew where Weaver went and what they did. until it was too late.] Where had Weaver gone and what had Weaver done?\n\nThey had gone to create the Nightmare Spell.\n\nSunny had been confused when he saw the final image of the vision shown to him by the sacrifice of the Snow Tyrant figure, but now he realized the truth. The vast void, the myriad of stars, then strings of silver light connecting them. What he had seen was the birth of the Nightmare Spell. Or rather, its evolutiоn from an infant state to the universal force it was today. To Weaver's version of an absolute law.\n\nThe many stars burning in the black void were the souls of living things. The smaller stars were the souls of humans, while the brighter ones belonged to spirits and deities. While most of them burned in lonesome solitude, some had already been connected by faint strings of silver light - those were the souls of the first carriers of the infant Nightmare Spell, like Ananke and her people.\n\nWeaver had chosen priests among mortals first and sent them to spread the Spell among the despairing refugees of the Doom War. In the chaos of the end of the world, it spread like wildfire, unnoticed and underestimated. laying a foundation for what would later become its final form.\n\nSlowly reached critical mass.\n\nAll it needed to evolve into its true tyrаnnical splendor, at that point, was a catalyst. And that catalyst was Weaver. Their death, to be precise.\n\nWhen Slayer killed the Demon of Fate in front of the Void Gate. which, apparently, was hidden in the heart of Shadow God. the seven Divine soul cores of the nebulous daemon had become the anchors of the great spell woven out of Strings of Fate, completing it.\n\nNo, rather, setting off its proliferation and completion. To truly become what it was meant to be, the great spell needed much more fuel than simply Weaver's soul.\n\nSo, it devoured the gods. It devoured the daemons, as well.\n\nThe eleven radiant constellations Sunny saw being consumed by the vast tendrils of silver light were the six gods and the five remaining daemons. By the time they realized what Weaver had done, it was already too late to stop it. So, their luminous Divine soul cores became nods of the Spell's weave, too.\n\nThat was how the Doom War had ended. With Weaver casting a Spell upon the Void from beyond the grave.\n\n'The Void?'\n\nNo. no, the Spell has not been cast upon the Void. It had been cast upon the being who was slumbering in the Void, and was supposed to awaken and consume all of existence once the Gate of the Void was open. Which it had been, even if Sunny still did not know who had opened them.\n\nHe let out a stifled laugh.\n\n'Unbelievable.'\n\nThe Nightmare Spell. Sunny had never seriously considered why it was called that. Whose nightmare was it that had given the Spell its name? He had simply assumed that it was the nightmare of everyone infected by it, or at least living in the world where Nightmare Creatures and the Spell run rampant and free.\n\nBut Sunny had been wrong. In truth. It was the nightmare of the Forgotten God. The Nightmare Spell was a lullaby.\n\nIt was a sorcery created to lull the God of Corruption back into slumber once someone - the Nine, possibly - had opened the Void Gate and stirred him awake. Why had existence not been destroyed when the Forgotten God was freed? It was because after escaping the Void, he had been imprisoned somewhere else. He had been imprisoned in an endless nightmare.\n\nThe Forgotten God slumbered and saw dreams. The Seeds of Nightmare, the Nightmare Gates, the Nightmare Creatures, the spreading Corruption. they were merely emanations of the nightmares he dreamed, slowly infecting what was left of the Flame.\n\n'Wait. wait.'\n\nSunny's eyes widened. The implications were too vast and enormous for him to handle easily. The death of the gods, the end of the War. the purpose of the Spell? Weaver's hidden intent? Sunny was not sure of his conclusions yet, but if he was right. Then he could extrapolate and glimpse one final truth.\n\nHe had always assumed that the Sixth Nightmare - the Nightmare that would make those who conquered it Divine - was the last one. But if the Spell had been cast to lull the Forgotten God to sleep, then there was one final Nightmare after that.\n\nThe Seventh Nightmare. Where the Forgotten God was imprisoned, dreaming restlessly. The conflict the challengers of that frightening Nightmare were meant to solve. was the conflict that plagued all of existence. The fate of the Flame.\n\n'I. I see now.'\n\nThe Spell kept the Forgotten God trapped within a Nightmare. And at the same time, it ruthlessly nurtured mortals to become the new gods. And kill him. That was the truth of the dying world.\n\nSunny remained motionless for a long while, and then sighed deeply.\n\n\"Ah, that's. a little bit too ambitious, even for me.\"\n\nThe Demon of Fate had promised to show him hоw to kill the gods. But really, Weaver could have just as well promised to show him how to create gods. That dastardly daemon.\n\n\"And what the hell did Weaver call me? Epigone? The nerve. bold words, coming from one - seventh of a deranged god!\"\n\nSunny might have stumbled on the true purpose of Weaver's scheme. but that did not mean that he had to fulfill it.\n\nAfter all, killing the Forgotten God was Weaver's goal. seemed to be Weaver's goal, at least. But it was not Sunny's goal, and neither was the goal of his comrades and companions. Of Nephis. Their goal was simply to make sure that humanity survived and build a new home for it in the Dream Realm. They had to become gods to accomplish that, but battling the Forgotten God? While that would mean solving the root of the problem, it was also beyond what they wanted to accomplish.\n\nThey wanted to build a shelter from the storms, not eradicate the concept of storms from existence.\n\n'Who could have thought that becoming a god would become a modest goal, one day?'\n\nSunny smiled darkly. 'To hell with Weaver.'\n\nThey were not marionettes that danced when a dead daemon pulled the strings. They would decide for themselves what they wanted to do, and what price they were willing to pay to achieve their goals.\n\nAt that moment, the mountain shuddered violently one last time, and he felt himself being pushed out of the miniature reаlm of Ariel's Game. The vast chamber of the Snow Palace disappeared, and for a moment, everything was dark. Or rather, everything was nothing and nowhere, beyond comprehension.\n\nThen, Sunny saw a vaguely familiar ceiling above him. And heard a very familiar voice.\n\n\"Well, well, well. Look who finally decided to show up!\"\n\nSunny groaned, feeling innumerable points of view and several weeks of memories crashing into his mind. It was his own voice, naturally."

    "content": "2413 Catching Up (With Myself)\n\nSome time later, Sunny was in a magnificent council room of the Jade Palace - two of him, even. One was sitting on the Shadow Chair with his legs crossed, while the other was sprawled on a tastefully decadent couch, covering his face with a hand and groaning pitifully. Both were nursing a mighty headache.\n\nThe incarnation on the chair was much better off than the other one, though. He was clean and neatly dressed, at least. His other self, the one who had just returned from a harrowing adventure in the realm of Ariel's Game, was covered in layers upon layers of ash, soot, dried blood, and dirt of all kinds. The hole in his chest barely healed, and the scar where his severed arm had been reattached was yet to disappear completely.\n\nAll in all, the sight of him was quite pathetic.\n\nThe first incarnation was a little disheveled too, though. That was because its body had gone through the agonizing process of inheriting the Flesh Weave as well - all of them had, really.\n\n\"That bastard.\" Sunny gave himself a venomous look and shook his head.\n\nHis other incarnation ignored him.\n\nOf course, the two of them were really a single person - once again - so whatever pain one of them felt, the other felt as well. The headache they were suffering from had been caused by the process of several weeks of isolated memories merging together, in fact. Still. If Sunny had an opportunity to appear composed and nonchalant while simultaneously throwing a tantrum and drowning in self-pity, he would be a fool to pass it up. To his quiet dismay, the intended audience was ignoring his masterful performance completely.\n\nSunny sighed. 'What a waste of a good tantrum.'\n\nNephis was paying him little attention, busy tending to Kai's wounds. Even though Sunny was almost entirely healed and even though he had caused the most severe of Kai's wounds himself, he was still unhappy with the lack of attention. Granted, the rest of the people gathered in the council room were all looking at him intently. One could even say that they were giving him death stares. To be fair. Seishan, Revel, and Hel had a reason to be unhappy with him.\n\nSunny coughed. \"What?\"\n\n[Do you have to ask?]\n\nEven Cassie's voice was full of reproach. All those days ago, when one of his incarnations and Kai had vanished suddenly from the Toу Room of the Jade Palace and left the startled Song sisters behind, three Nightmare Creatures took their place. To be precise, a Cursed Tyrant and two Cursed Beasts took their place. Sunny had already been moving his other incarnations toward Ravenheart, stunned by the sudden loss of connection to the naughty shadow, but he would have never made it to the Jade Palace in time. The three Song sisters could have died right there and then.\n\nBut they didn't. Of course, they would have never been able to defeat a Cursed Tyrant, let alone one commanding two Cursed Beasts. Luckily, the narrow confines of the Toy Room bought them a few seconds to save themselves and Seishan used those seconds quite cunningly.\n\nShe lured the distressing creatures toward the Jade Queen's dollhouse, which swallowed them up just like it had swallowed her and her sisters decades ago. The Cursed Ones were still trapped inside of it. In fact, over the last two weeks, Sunny had spent numerous hours staring at the tiny figures of the detestable horrors wandering the gorgeously decorated rooms of the Dollhouse. Someone had to guard the two harrowing toys - the Dollhouse and the Jade Board - at all times, after all. So, Sunny had spent the better half of the month doing just that. After a while, Nephis joined him as well. they did not know what would come out of the Jade Board next, so having this much power concentrated in Ravenheart was a necessity.\n\nThe missing incarnation remained lost, but it wasn't like they did not have any information about what it was doing at all. In fact, they could see the figures move across the game board twice a day just fine. Sunny could also feel every excruciating moment of his soul receiving damage, and saw new shades entering his Soul Sea from time to time.\n\nPowerful, harrowing shades. Oh, and then the shadow of Condemnation went and vanished entirely.\n\nHis dastardly avatar seemed to be having great fun out there all by himself. All of this culminated in Kai stumbling into the Toy Room out of thin air. Before Sunny could let out a sigh of relief, though, he found himself in utter agony, feeling his flesh rebuild and rearrange himself.\n\nAnd as soon as he recovered, the prodigal incarnation returned, flooding his mind with the memоries of vicious battles, startling revelations, and truths so shocking that he was almost sent into a catatonic state. Luckily, he also regained memories of somewhat coming to terms with this new knowledge - initially, at least - so that episode did not last long.\n\nSunny looked at Nephis, then responded Cassie's mental question.\n\n[I don't have to ask, but come on. They weren't even maimed that badly. How long do I have to spend in the dog house?]\n\nWhatever wounds the Song sisters had received were almost instantaneously healed by Nephis from a vast distance - that, too, was a reason they were alive and well. Sunny might have been a little reckless, but could he really be blamed? If Seishan had not told him about visiting the Toy Room numerous times as a kid and returning alive and more or less unscathed each time, he would have exercised more caution. Why would a Sovereign be extra careful in a place where literal children used to play?\n\nKai was fully healed by now, so Nephis left him and walked over to the head of the table. Sitting down, she studied Sunny for a while - both of them in turn - and opened her mouth to speak.\n\nBefore she could, however, Death Singer sрoke first:\n\n\"Look, look! There's two of them. Changing Star, can I have one? Please? Pretty please?\"\n\nNephis closed her mouth and stared at her silently. Her face remained expressionless. But the curtains behind Death Singer seemed to have suddenly caught on fire, for some reason. \"Ouch!\" Death Singer shook embers out of her hair and gave Nephis a sorrowful glare. \"Greedy!\"\n\nNephis stared at her for a few more moments, then took a deep breath, extinguished the curtains with a thought, and glanced back to Sunny.\n\n\"So? What exactly happened?\"\n\nHe smiled awkwardly.\n\n\"Well, do you want the short version or the long version?\"\n\nNephis shrugged.\n\n\"Let's start with a short summary.\"\n\nSunny scratched the back of his head.\n\n\"Okay. Let's see.\""

    "content": "2414 The Incredible Adventures and Astonishing Deeds of Heroic Dreamer Sunless and his Dashing Best Friend Nightingale, Abridged (Volume IX)\n\nSunny leaned back in his chair.\n\nHe had a story to tell. And after having suffered through the story personally, he was going to enjoy himself telling it.\n\nHe begаn off in a solemn tone:\n\n\"A long time agо, the Demon of Fate and the Demon of Dread played a game. Only, being insane bastards, they played with Great and Cursed Nightmare Creatures instead of game pieces. And - what would you know? - Kai and I got sucked into the Death Game realm and given a choice between winning an unwinnable game or meeting our deaths. So, we went and won.\"\n\nNephis sighed. \".A little bit less short, please.\"\n\nSeishan, meanwhile, glanced between them with a stunned expression. \"Excuse me? Demon of Fate, Demon of Dread? Cursed Nightmare Creatures?\"\n\nSunny grinned.\n\n\"You're excused. Anyway, where do I begin? First, we eradicated a swarm of one hundred Great Beasts. Then, we graduated to fighting Cursed abominations. The first one we killed was an infinite worm. And I mean literally infinite. That thing seemed like trouble, but actually, it died when I simply stepped on it.\"\n\nRevel stared at him foг a few seconds, then turned to Kai.\n\nKai waved a hand weakly, still exhausted from the ordeal. His voice was faint: \"It's true. it's all true.\"\n\nHer eyes widened. \"No, but.\"\n\nHowever, Sunny interrupted her.\n\n\"So, next we found a cozy temple on the peak of a mystical mountain and waited to be beset by a pack of frightening wolves led by a Cursed Demon, as well as a very impressive training dummy. I was really hungry by then, but sadly, there was no wolf meat left by the time I was done with them. In fact, there was barely any mountain left as well. I sort of blew it up to smithereens. it was quite a sight.\"\n\nNephis shifted slightly and gave him a strange look. \"You. blew up a mountain?\"\n\nSunny raised his chin.\n\n\"Sure did!\"\n\nHe thought she would be proud of him, but for some reason, her gaze seemed a little dejected.\n\nIf Sunny did not know any better, he would have thought that Nephis was. pouting?\n\nBut that was impossible, naturally. After all, she was Changing Star, the last daughter of the Immortal Flame. The fearless Sovereign of Humanity. Surely, she would not mind him stealing her signature move?\n\n'Right. No way!'\n\nSunny cleared his throat awkwardlу.\n\n\"Well, in any case. Next, we killed another Cursed Demon and two Cursed Monsters. How? To be honest, I don't actually remember, but it must have been in quite a spectacular fashion.\"\n\nDeath Singer glanced at him, then at the other him laying on the couch with a miserable expression on his grimy. but unmistakably dashing. face. She raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Uh. wait a minute? How can you not remember slaying a Cursed Demon and two Cursed Monsters, though?\"\n\nThose were Cursed Nightmare Creatures they were talking about! Actual deities!\n\nSunny gave her his most sincere, innocent smile and shrugged nonchalantly.\n\n\"It must have slipped my mind.\"\n\nThere was silence in the room for a while. Eventually, everyone turned to look at Kai in unison.\n\nExposed to their gazes, Kai smiled awkwardly.\n\n\"Oh. actually, I don't remember either.\"\n\nNephis and the Song sisters seemed deeply betraуed by that statement. Their reproachful gazes were obviously saying.\n\nYou too, Nightingale?\n\nYou too?\n\nKai coughed and glanced away in embarrassment.\n\nSunny chuckled.\n\n\"After that, though, something incredible happened!\"\n\nFour gazes turned to him once again. He paused for a few seconds, and continued in a happy tone:\n\n\"We finally procured a meal! Well, at least I did. There was this Cursed Beast, you see - an endless swarm of rats. And I mean literally endless. Turns out, a cursed rat roasted over lava is simply delicious. Blighted, diseased, and poisonous, but nonetheless piquant and delectable. I positively stuffed myself, and can you blame me?\"\n\nDeath Singer paled a little and moved away from the incarnation on the couch. Her mumble was almost inaudible, but it still made Nephis let out a long sigh.\n\n\".On second thought, you can have that one, Changing Star. He's all yours!\"\n\nThen, she glanced at the incineration on the chair and batted her eyelashes.\n\nSunny wisely pretended not to notice.\n\n\"Now that I had a full stomach, it was finally time to take on the Cursed Tyrant! The Cursed Tyrant was an acquaintance of an acquaintance, as it turned out - quite a pleasant fellow, really. We had a nice chat.\"\n\nThis time, it was Cassie's who interrupted him.\n\n[You. you chatted. with a Cursed Tyrant?]\n\nHer voice seemed to tremble a little as it resounded in his head.\n\nSunny smiled.\n\n\"Indeed, I did. We discussed refined topics like philosophy, theology, and peaceful resolution of violent conflicts. Sadly, our enlightened debate reached an impasse. so I cut off the Cursed Tyrant's head.\"\n\nHe sighed and glanced into the distance thoughtfully. \"That, I find, is a surefire way to win an argument.\"\n\nThe council room was filled with a stunned, incredulous silence for a long time.\n\nSunny did not hurry to say anything else, either. At least for a while. Then, he glanced at his audience and smiled again.\n\n\"And here I am!\"\n\nHe scratched the tip of his nose.\n\n\"Well, technically, I've been here all along. But you know what I mean.\"\n\nHis smile widened.\n\nNephis stared at him for some time, then rubbed her temples.\n\n\"Yes. here you are.\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, then glanced at Kai. \"Did he forget to mention anything?\"\n\nKai considered the question seriously.\n\n\"I don't think so? Well, I guess. there was also that dragon.\"\n\nNephis suddenly stood up, interrupting him.\n\n\"Actually, never mind. Let's continue this conversation later, shall we? Better yet. forget I asked.\"\n\nHer gaze softened.\n\n\"You two must be awfully tired. Go wash off the grime of battle, eat a proper meal, and rest. There will be plenty of time tomorrow.\"\n\nKai nodded in gratitude and rose to leave. Sunny stood up, as well.\n\n\"If you'll excuse me, then.\"\n\nBoth of his incarnations headed for the door.\n\nThe one covered in soot was let go, but the other one. someone suddenly caught him by the collar.\n\nTurning around, Sunny was met by Neph's heated gaze.\n\n\"Not you. You stay here. if you will. I have a few questions to ask.\"\n\n[Yes. I have a few questions to ask, too?]\n\nCassie's voice had an edge to it now.\n\nSunny forced out a pleasant smile.\n\n\"Why, naturally.\"\n\nSomething was telling him that he was in for a long, restless night.\n\nAt the same time, he found himself in a peculiar predicament.\n\nThe events that had transpired in the world at large in these last few weeks were old news for him, but at the same time, he just learned about them.\n\nSo, Sunny found himself in a strange state of being surprised and stunned by something he already knew.\n\n'Rain. did what?'\n\nThe incarnation who had just left the council room paused for a moment and covered its face with a palm."

    "title": "2415 Huge Huge Trouble.docx",
    "content": "2415 Huge, Huge Trouble\n\n\"Everyone on the floor! This is a robbery!\"\n\nThere was gunfire, screams, and the sound of breaking furniture as a group of masked men burst into the foyer of a prestigious bank. The startled clients froze, paralyzed by shock and fear; the workers raised their trembling hands into the air.\n\nThe Awakened security guards lunged forward while summoning their Memories, but a few seconds later, they were already sprawled on the ground, groaning or unconscious.\nJune should have known that his first mission as а member of the Shadow Clan would go terribly wrong.\n\n'Ah. I hate amateurs.'\n\nHe had spent close to a month in the peaceful silence of the Dark City, being trained by the graceful stone Devil, learning how to use the Mark of Shadows, and establishing bonds with other mеmbers of the Shadow Clan. Usually, a new recruit would have been given more time to adjust to their role and get used to things, but June was in somewhat of a unique position. His status as an elite among the black market operatives gave him a perfect cover to be seen in places where other members of the Shadow Clan could not enter without drawing attention, as well as a convenient reason to meddle in all kinds of unsavory business.\n\nSo, he had been sent on a mission earlier than usual. And now, he found himself in the middle of a bank robbery.\n\nTo be precise, June was wearing black combat fatigues, hiding his face behind an Abomination mask, and holding an automatic rifle while watching his fellow robbers herd the hostages to the center of the foyer. The rest were breaking into the security system of the bank to activate the lockdown protocol - having made sure that everyone was proceeding smoothly, he turned to the person who had fired a burst of bullets into the ceiling and regarded him chillingly.\n\nThe man sensed his gaze and turned, asking in a hoarse voice:\n\n\"What?\"\n\nInstead of answering, June silently punched him in the solar plexus. His jab had not been telegraphed in any way and lacked a wind-up, so it did not seem very forceful. And yet, the Awakened henchman folded in two and fell to his knees with a pained gasp, struggling to breathe.\n\nJune calmly grabbed him by the hair, jerked his head upward, and asked in a chillingly calm tone:\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nHe pointed to the ceiling.\n\n\"Have you watched too many movies, moron? This bank is built to withstand Nightmare Gates. It is a box made from monster hide and reinforced alloy, so where do you think your bullets go when you start shooting randomly? Do you want to kill someone with a ricochet?\"\n\nThe man hissed, trying to struggle free from his grasp, and glanced up at June with fury. However, that wrath was replaced with fear after meeting his cold, murderous, and eerily calm gaze.\n\nThe enforcer shivered behind the snarling mask.\n\n\"S - sory, Corsair.\"\n\nJune watched him for a second more, mentally reevaluating the situation. The people who had reached out to hire him for this job were not his usual clientele. They were not professionals assembling a crew of reliable specialists - instead, they were zealots.\n\nUsually, June would not have taken such a contract, but the peculiar cult these zealots belonged to had been on the Shadow Clan's radar for a number of months now. This was their first serious move, so Awakened Kim had sent him to learn more about their goals and to make sure that nothing went wrong during the attack on the bank.\n\nIn short, the robbers were a motley crew of a dozen or so believers and a few hired hands - June included. He was one of the more experienced people among them, so even the zealots seemed to be treating him with respect and trepidation. Still, maybe it was a good idea to make them respect him a little more.\n\nJune glanced at the kneeling enforcer, considering if it was worth it to make an example out of him.\n\n\"Is there a problem here?\"\n\nHe shifted his gaze and glanced at a delicate young woman with fair skin and blonde hair who had approached them. She was the only one of them dressed as a civilian and wearing no mask - granted, she did change the color of her hair and the features of her face with a camouflage charm. She had been hiding among the clients of the bank when the attack started, looking weak and inconspicuous. That was why the guards had not paid the delicate young woman any attention and were taken down by her in a matter of moments as a result. Now that they were expertly tied up and under watch, she approached June.\n\nThe young woman was another specialist hired by the zealots. She was also his fellow Shadow, Fleur.\n\nRay was also here, posing as a mundаne person and being restrained alongside other hostages. The three of them were sent on this mission together, with June taking charge.\n\nHowever, they were not supposed to show any sign that they knew each other prior to being hired to rob the bank. Fleur had to stay away from him to avoid drawing attention. June knew her well enough by now to know how competent she was despite being quite young, so there had to be a reason why she had gone against his instructions.\n\nSomething was wrong. Letting go of the kneeling henchman, he wiped his hand on his fatigues and gave her a frigid look.\n\n\"No problem whatsoever. We were just having a friendly chat.\"\n\nUsing the opportunity, the henchman scrambled away. Fleur studied June for a moment more, then nodded and turned away. Her delicate fingers, though, moved to form subtle signs. June glanced the other away, paying no attention to them.\n\nHe did, however, sense the signs formed by the shadow of her fingers on the floor.\n\n[We are in huge, huge trouble.]\n\nMaintaining a nonchalant attitude, he tensed inwardly.\n\n[Look right.]\n\nJune did just that.\n\nThe hostages were divided into two groups. The larger group consisted of mundane humans - Ray was among them, sitting on the floor with his hands tied behind his back. Despite being amateurs in June's eyes, the robbers were not, in fact, hapless. They had reliable means of identifying Awakened, it was just that Ray's Aspect made most of such means useless.\n\nThe smaller group, consisting of only a handful of people, was isolated to June's right. He glanced at them, immediately noticing two stunning young women - both handcuffed with special enchanted cuffs. His attention was not focused on them because of their beauty, naturally, but rather because both seemed much too calm for the situation they were in, which was not at all a good sign.\n\nJune frowned, feeling a very bad premonition.\n\nOne girl was of medium height, with tan skin and ashen hair, looking at the world with the imperious, cold gaze of a Legacy scion. The other looked much more approachable, beguiling, even, looking around with lively curiosity in her gemlike onyx eyes and a slight smile playing on her soft lips.\n\nIt was that easy, captivating smile that made it hard to look away from her. Well, that and the fact that she looked vaguely familiar.\n\nNo, not just vaguely.\n\nFair skin, raven-black hair, the girl strongly reminded June of someone he knew all too well.\n\nHis mouth was suddenly dry.\n\n\"Don't tell me.\"\n\nFleur gave him another signal.\n\n[Yes. that is the Princess of Shadows, Rain. Boss's little sister.]\n\nJune closed his eyes for a moment, remembering every curse word he knew.\n\n'You gotta be kidding me!'"

    "content": "2416 Can of Worms\n\nThe assailants moved rapidly. Befоre too long, the bank's security system was in their hands, and the heavy armor plates meant to protect the building in case a Nightmare Gate opened nearby fell down, turning it into an impregnable - an inescapable - fortress.\n\nOf course, all things were relative. Nоthing was truly impregnable in the world of the Nightmare Spell - the bank could withstand the attacks of Awakened abominations, and possibly a few Fallen ones as well, but far more frightening creatures were entering the waking world more and more frequently these days. What seemed like reliable security measures just a few years ago were rapidly falling behind and becoming obsolete.\n\nThe robbers were not really worried about Fallen and Corrupted abominations, either. What threatened them more were humans - government forces would arrive at the scene soon enough, including powerful Ascended officers. If their luck was especially bad, even a Saint could show up to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe chances of encountering someone they had no business encountering were especially high because this bank was an old and prestigious one, having existed from before the descent of the Spell. Many prominent families, including storied Legacy clans, used its vault to store precious heirlooms and priceless treasures - a concerned powerhouse could appear out of the blue not out of a sense of duty or altruism, but simply to prevent their own family from being robbed.\n\n'Ah. it's getting worse and worse.' June sighed quietly. The presence of hostages would buy the robbers some time, but not enough time. They had to finish the job rapidly and get away before things went south.\n\nBy now, the mundane clients and workers were tied up and sitting on the floor near the east wall of the foyer, while the Awakened visitors and security guards were restrained and kept under watch near the west wall.\n\nAmong them was the mysterious Princess of the Shadow Clan. June threw a dark look at the gorgeous young woman and groaned inwardly. 'Blast it.'\n\nOn the day he joined the Shadow Clan, Awakened Kim warned him about three people - her husband, Aiko, and the Princess. He had become good pals with Luster in no time and built rapport with the Shadow Fairy in no time. However, June had sworn to stay as far away from Boss's little sister as possible. He did not need to open that particular can of worms. And now here she was, in front of him. .Locked, restrained, taken hostage, and surrounded by militant zealots. What was going to happen to June if even a single hair fell from her head?\n\n'What was it that Awakened Kim said?' When it came to their Boss, being killed was not an escape from suffering. it was merely the beginning.\n\nJune had remained calm in many situations that would have made most Awakened faint. He had survived horrors beyond imagination and glanced Death in the eye without flinching on innumerable occasions. But now, he suddenly felt nervous.\n\nForming subtle signs with his fingers, he sent Fleur a message:\n\n[We must make sure that absolutely no harm comes to her.]\n\nFleur did not answer for a few seconds. And when she did, there was something peculiar about her response.\n\n[Harm comes to her? No, Corsair. You don't understand.] She turned faintly and gave him a peculiar look. [You should be concerned about the zealots, instead. We must make sure that Rain doesn't take them all out before we can complete our mission.]\n\nDeciphering the ominous message, June raised an eyebrow behind his mask. [Why? Is there a possibility that she'll go on some kind of massacre?]\n\nFleur stared at him with an incredulous expression for a brief moment, then glanced away.\n\n[Don't be silly. She's a pacifist.] Now, what the hell was that supposed to mean?\n\nJune would have loved to learn more, but at that moment, a man wearing a Tyrant mask walked into the empty space between the two groups of hostages. His low voice resounded in the foyer of the bank, making a few of them flinch:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I am Tyrant. You have the honor of being my guests tonight - show proper manners, and you'll have a pleasant visit. If not.\" His dreadful gaze landed on the hostages, forcing a few to reel back. \"I am afraid you won't enjoy the consequences. My people won't enjoy washing blood and viscera off our clothes, either, so do consider acting with decorum and following our instructions faithfully. Don't give me a reason to revoke my hospitality.\"\n\nThe man was the leadеr of the group - a figure of prominence in the cult and a seasoned warrior, at least judging by what June had discerned about him. Worst of all, he was a Master. June had taken down a Master or two in the past, but it was never easy - especially when he did not have the advantage of striking from stealth or luring the adversary into an ambush. Assassinating an Ascended was one thing, but facing one in an honest battle was not something he ever wished to repeat. He just hoped that the Princess would not draw the Tyrant's attention. Nothing good would come if she did.\n\nAs June was somberly contemplating contingencies, the dead silence that followed the Tyrant's address was suddenly broken by a loud whisper.\n\n\"Wow. Tamar, did you hear that? That was a proper villain's speech, wasn't it? So cool! That guy is too full of himself, but let's give credit where credit is due - he's really eloquent, for a pompous dimwit, I mean.\"\n\n\"Rain. can you shut up? Please.\"\n\n\"Do you think he gave that speech impromptu, or had he rehearsed it at home? If it's the former, amazing! Great improvisational skills. I sort of think that it's the latter, though. Can you imagine? That'd be so funny, him standing in front of a mirror, practicing a sinister voice.\"\n\n\"Stop talking, fool. I'm begging you.\"\n\n\"No, I'm just saying. do villains like that utter buffoon over there also get stage fright? I'd be mortified, having to give a speech in front of a hostile crowd. He has guts, that's for sure!\"\n\n\"Ah. You've done did it now.\"\n\n\"Huh? Why is everyone looking at me?\" The loud whispers finally grew silent. Everyone in the bank - the robbers, the hostages, and the Tyrant himself - were indeed staring at the two young women.\n\nThe Princess of Shadow blinked a couple of times, then smiled awkwardly. \"Oh, was I too loud? Sorry, sorry. Uh. continue as you were!\"\n\nJune shook and suppressed the desire to shoot someone. possibly himself?\n\nIn all his career as a soldier, mercenary, and occasionally an assassin. 'Argh! She's exactly like her brother!'"

    "content": "2417 Harmless, Hilarious Hostage\n\nRain glanced at the masked thugs and smiled innocently.\n\n'That should be enough, right?'\n\nLife was really unpredictable. Today was supposed to be a usual day, and yet, she had found herself in the middle of a bank robbery. Rain would have blamed her awful luck, but she suspected that luck had nothing to do with it. rather, it must have been Tamar.\n\nShe gave the Legacy girl a sidelong glance.\n\nThe two of them were visiting NQSC on business - well, Rain was, while Tamar had come along as her friend and unofficial bodyguard.\n\nChief Bethany had achieved a groundbreaking feat by establishing a hydroelectric plant in the Dream Realm, but she could not return to the waking world to share her research with the part of the academic community still residing here. If she did, she would be pulled into the First Nightmare - so, an intermediary was needed to make a report on her behalf.\n\nRain was the only Awakened on the team, so she was a natural choice despite being an intern. She had been wanting to visit NQSC for the longest time, as well. This was where she had grown up, after all, but after leaving the city for Ravenheart numerous years ago, she never had the opportunity to return.\n\nSo, Rain and Tamar used the Dream Gate to come back to the waking world. The conference where she was supposed to make the report was supposed to start in a few hours, but before they went to the venue, Tamar asked to visit the bank where her clan had a deposit box. And here they were, restrained and being stared down by a dozen armed assailants.\n\nSaid assailants were staring at Rain with overflowing malice right now.\n\n\"Oh, was I too loud? Sorry, sorry. Uh. continue as you were.\"\n\nShe glanced at the leader of the bandits awkwardly.\n\nOf course, she had not just offended him for fun.\n\nRain might have been young, but she knew people well. She had met all kinds of men and women - numerous of them at their worst or at their best. Crisis and war had a way of drawing out one's true nature, and both were plentiful in the world of the Nightmare Spell.\n\nSo, having rapidly glimpsed the Tyrant's true nature, she knew where things would go from the moment he began to speak.\n\nThe callous man needed to make a crowd of frightened people submit to him - it was an imperative necessity if he wanted to emerge from this conflict with minimal lоsses. But frightened people were rarely rational. mere threats were not going to work.\n\nIf he knew what he was doing, and he seemed like someone who did, he would illustrate his promise of violence with something more convincing than words. She was certain that the Tyrant was going to make an example out of someone, even if no one challenged his authority immediately. their blood would prove his point and make the rest of the hostages believe his threats.\n\nThat was why Rain had provoked the man. If someone had to be made an example of, it would be much better for her to play that role - Rain was an Awakened, after all, and could endure much more punishment than one of the mundane hostages would. And if the Tyrant went too far, she and Tamar could offer far more resistance.\n\nShe was not arrogant enough to think that the two of them were invincible. In fact, in other circumstances, Rain might have acted with more caution.\n\nBut she had noticed Ray among the hostages. Fleur was here, too, having infiltrated the criminal crew - their disguises did not fool Rain, and after sensing them communicating with the shadow signs, she concluded that the tall man in the mask of a grotesque Devil was a member of the Shadow Clan, as well.\n\nThe mysterious Devil emanated a sense of confidence and dreadful composure. She could not see his face, but his piercing blue eyes were cold and indifferent, as if he was not at all disturbed by the tense and potentially lethal situation. He seemed like a man with ice flowing through his veins.\n\nRain did not know him, and he did not seem to recognize her either, so he was probably someone Sunny had recruited recentlу. Collecting unique people seemed to be his latest hobby.\n\nIn any case, there were five members of Shadow Clan in the bank and ten assailants - meaning that while Rain was indeed putting herself in danger, that danger was not too serious. Five Shadows was more than enough to handle this rabble. The only problem was the Tyrant himself, who seemed to be a Master. however, the magnitude of that problem remained to be seen.\n\nAs the callous man turned his glassy gaze to her, Rain smiled and whispered two words almost inaudibly to assign herself a pair of Epithets.\n\n\"I am Harmless, Hilarious Promise of a Distant Sky.\"\n\nPeople were less likely to attack those they were not threatened by, and far more likely to treat those who made them laugh well. Now, she could only hope that the Tyrant would not decide to go too hard on hеr.\n\nHe studied her for a few seconds, then approached her with slow, measured steps and stared her down, making her shiver. Something was lacking from the man's gaze. empathy, possibly, or possibly even humanity.\n\n'Ah, I hope it won't hurt too much.'\n\nBut as long as the other hostages were spared, Rain was alright with hurting a little.\n\nTo her relief, however, the Tyrant suddenly let out a low, unnerving chuckle.\n\n\"Why, thank you, young lady. Eloquence is indeed something a man in my line of work needs to excel at.\"\n\nWith that, he shifted his glassy gaze to Tamar. The Tyrant remained silent for a moment, and then spoke in an even tone:\n\n\"Tamar of Sorrow. what a pleasant surprise.\"\n\nLegacies were no different from celebrities, so it was no surprise that he recognized her - even if Clan Sorrow had lost its former prominence, numerous people would know what she looked like.\n\nThe Tyrant seemed to smile behind his mask, and then spoke over his shoulder in an emotionless voice:\n\n\"Corsair, take these young ladies down with us. It will be easier to get into the vault with them around.\"\n\nRain let out a tiny sigh of relief and threw a glance at the tall man in the Devil mask, Corsair. The newest member of the Shadow Clan was looking her way, as well.\n\n'Huh.'\n\nBut why did it seem like he wanted to strangle her?"

    "content": "2418 VIPs\n\nThe assailants moved with speed and discipline one would expect from well-trained soldiers, not thugs who would go around robbing banks. Before Rain could even come to terms with the shifting situation, she and Tamar were being escorted into the depths of the building.\n\nThe Tyrant was leading the way, with six of his men following. The two hostages were walking behind, with Corsair and Fleur guarding them.\n\nWhich meant that four Awakened bandits stayed behind to guard the rest of the hostages, and were now alone with Ray.\n\n'Can we take them down?'\n\nRain and Tamar werе restrained with enchanted cuffs that made their essence peculiarly sluggish and prevented them from summoning any Memories. The former would have interfered with their ability to use Aspects Abilities if not for the Mark of Shadows. Every member of the Shadow Clan was a master at controlling essence due to bearing the Mark and undergoing extensive training - so, they were all but immune to the insidious influence of the enchanted restraints.\n\nRain had dismissed the Epithets she had assigned herself to avoid the Tyrant's wrath, and was now considering her next steps.\n\nFirst. She glanced at the rifles the assailants were carrying. It was strange to see Awakened using contemporary weapons instead of Memories. Sure, while it was difficult to seriously harm a Master with a bullet, Awakened themselves were far more susceptible to modern firearms. In fact, it was only marginally harder to kill them with a high-powered shot than it would be a mundane human. So, the rifles posed quite a real threat to Rain, Tamar, and the other Shadows. Still, possibly because she had spent so many years in the Dream Realm, seeing Awakened carrying modern weapons felt very peculiar. More than that, Memories were simply a better choice - not only because they were deadlier, more powerful, and could possess potent enchantments, but also because they were far easier to carry and conceal.\n\nRain signed a question:\n\n[Why are you armed that way?]\n\nIt was Corsair who responded, hinting that he was in charge of this mission.\n\n[Memories are unique, so they are easier to identify and trace. Anonymity is key in these matters.]\n\nShe considered his words for a moment. That was an unexpected but logical perspective. But the readiness of his response was a little peculiar.\n\n[You seem to know a lot about this stuff. Robbed many banks recently?]\n\nCorsair responded calmly. It was a weird thing, but after practicing for a while, one could discern tone and еmotion in the movement of the other person's shadow when communicating with shadow signs. Fleur, for example, signed softly and smoothly. The new recruit, on the other hand, signed precisely and mechanically, with the measured indifference of a finely tuned machine.\n\n[.Not many.]\n\nRain and Tamar looked at each other. Where, exactly, had her brother found this guy?\n\nHe was sort of cool.\n\n'Wait, did he really rob a bank before?'\n\nCome to think of it, there had indeed been a similar mission in the works.\n\nThe assailants were descending into the basement of the bank, with one of them quickly unlocking the armored doors that stood in their way from a handheld console. They seemed well-prepared for the job, even if locking themselves in a bank with the govеrnment forces guaranteed to arrive and surround the building rapidly was pure madness.\n\nRain signed another question:\n\n[What is their plan, exactly?]\n\nCorsair responded after a short pause.\n\n[We were not told the details. One of them has a spatial movement Aspect Ability, though. He is their escape route.]\n\n'.Wait, he must be really new. How come he uses shadow signs so confidently, then?'\n\nIt took her ages to learn this peculiar manner of communication. Was this guy a genius?\n\nThat was so unfair!\n\nRain suppressed her envy and asked the final question:\n\n[So, what do we do? Shall we take them down?]\n\nCorsair shifted faintly, and she could feel his cold gaze.\n\n[Please don't do anything yet, Princess. At least not until they reveal all their cards.]\n\nRain frowned. It was reasonable to assume that the Tyrant had an ace or two up his sleeve, but.\n\n[What if they hurt the hostages?]\n\nHis response was curt.\n\n[They won't.]\n\nShe had no choice but to believe him.\n\n'So.'\n\nCorsair, Fleur, and Ray were here to spy on the assailants and learn something about them, then take them down. Which meant that these were not easy criminals.\n\nRain wanted to scratch her head, but sadly, her hands were restrained. Who, then? Misguided loyalists refusing to accept the fall of the Valor and Song regime? Disciples of some strange doomsday cult?\n\nSeveral of those had sprouted out of nowhere after Sister-In-Law made her explosive announcement.\n\nFinally, they reached the vault. This one, the Tyrant's tech specialist could not unlock - so, the leader of the assailants invited Tamar forward, gesturing to the complicated lock.\n\n\"If you will, Lady Tamar.\"\n\nShe stared at him chillingly for a few seconds, then nodded to the lowest part of the contraption.\n\n\"Am I supposed to scan my fingerprints while my hands are tied behind my back?\"\n\nHer clan had a deposit box in the vault, so her data would by stored in the bank VIP client repository - that alone would probably not unlock the door, but it would help the tech specialist deceive the system.\n\nThe robbers studied her silently. Finally, the Tyrant pushed one of them forward.\n\n\"Take the cuffs off.\"\n\nThen, he turned his glassy gaze back to Tamar.\n\n\"Please don't do anything rash, young lady. If you do, I'll start with cutting off a finger. I know that you won't be deterred by such a easy threat - Legacies can be quite stubborn, after all - but do understand that I don't mean your finger. I mean you little friend over there and it won't end with a single finger, either.\"\n\nRain instinctively clenched her fists, hiding her fingers. Tamar remained nonchalant, staring at the Tyrant darkly, while Corsair tilted his head a little.\n\n'Poor Tyrant. he doesn't know what's coming for him.'\n\nRain almost pitied the man.\n\nThe cuffs came off.\n\nTamar walked over to the lock and unhurriedly scanned her retinas and fingerprints. Lastly, she channeled a little bit of her essence into a special spelltech pattern that lit up, recognizing it. Soon, the heavy door let out a series of low clicks and opened slowly.\n\nFar above, in the foyer of the bank, Ray was sitting on the floor among the frightened hostages. His hands were zip-tied behind his back, and there was an appropriately scared expression on his face. His eyes, however, hid a hint of boredom. The four robbers were watching the hostages like hawks, but no one seemed to be paying him much attention.\n\nRay remained motionless. But. Unnoticed by anyone, a black snake slowly slithered out of his sleeve. The snake coiled on the floor, then raised its triangular head. Its fangs bit into the zip tie, easily slicing it apart.\n\nRay brought his hands forward and rubbed his wrists. Then, he reached back and picked up the snake gently. A moment later, its body rippled and turned into a razor-sharp black blade.\n\nStill ignored by everyone, Ray inhaled deeply and slowly rose from the ground."

    "title": "2419 Bank Vault.docx",
    "content": "2419 Bank Vault\n\nDeеp in the bowels of the heavily fortified bank, the colossal doors of the vault opened, and the Tyrant led his men inside. Rain and Tamar were forced to follow, as well, finding themselves in a.\n\n'Huh?'\n\nThe bank vault looked nothing like what Rain had expected.\n\nIn fact, it looked no different from a tastefully decorated, luxurious apartment. There was a spacious guest room with lavish furniture, video walls showing a scenic seaside landscape, and a sophisticated climate control system that imitated an invigorating breeze.\n\nSeveral doors led out of the guest room, opening into a gorgeously furnished kitchen, a neat and cozy bedroom, a recreation room with a state-of-the-art entertainment system, a stylish parlour. There was everything a person needed to live a comfortable life here, not having to step outside at all.\n\nA woman in a muted, but fashionable business attire was standing in the middle of the guest room, looking at the Tyrant with a tense expression.\n\n'What is going on?'\n\nRain looked at Tamar and Corsair furtively, but neither of them seemed surprised by the scene.\n\nThe Tyrant gave a nod, and his people dispersed across the luxurious vault apartment? Vault? The man himself, meanwhile, walked over to the woman and gave her his usual cold, glassy stare.\n\nHe spoke first:\n\n\"Pleasure to meet you, vault keeper. Now I presume there is no point in expecting your willing cooperation?\"\n\nThe woman shook her head somberly.\n\nThe Tyrant chuckled.\n\n\"Suit yourself. Tоrture it is, then.\"\n\nShe gave him a cold smile.\n\n\"You seem to know your basics. Then you should know that people like me are employed for a reason, as well. My Aspect makes me immune to pain, so try your worst.\"\n\nRain finally understood what was happening. In hindsight, it was quite obvious.\n\nThis bank was an old and prestigious one, offering its services to numerous prominent Legacy families. And what was it that Legacy clans would want to keep safe?\n\nJewelry, precious materials, pieces of priceless art?\n\nWell, that too. But primarily, the most valuable assets Legacies possessed were Memories and Echoes.\n\nOnly Awakened could own those, though.\n\nIn case the heirs of a family had not undergone the Awakening yet, a reliable intermediary was needed to make sure that they would receive their inheritance - Awakened led perilous lives, after all, and could die at any moment. Parents were not always able to transfer the Aspect Legact relics and valuable Memories to their children themselves. Adult Legacies were most likely in the habit of entrusting the heirlooms of their clan to a reliable, neutral party for safekeeping, especially before embarking on a life-threatening journey like challenging a Nightmare or participating in a war, for example.\n\nHence the need for the bank, and for the woman who was standing in front of the Tyrant with a cold smile.\n\nHe had called her the vault keeper, but more precisely, she was the vault. She was the Awakened who kept the Memories and Echoes entrusted to the bank in her soul. That was why she was locked underground, living in the safety of this luxurious, heavily protected apartment.\n\nAnd just in case someone invaded the underground safe room, the Vault Keeper possessed an Aspect that negated pain - and was therefore immune to more mundane forms of torture, making it that much harder to force her to transfer the Memories and Echoes against her will.\n\nBut where there was a will, there was a way.\n\nRain's expression darkened.\n\nThere was probably an armored room with mundane deposit boxes somewhere here, as well, but that was not the Tyrant's goal.\n\nHis goal was the Vault Keeper.\n\nThe man studied her silently for a moment, and then seemed to smile behind his mask.\n\n\"Bold words, but will you be responsible for them? We will see just how potent your Aspect is soon, Vault Keeper. Are you truly immune to all pain? Does that encompass all physical pain, or do you not feel the agony of having your soul torn apart, either? What about fear? Do you not fear watching yourself be maimed and disfigured, even while not feeling anything?\"\n\nShe pursed her lips, but remained silent, looking at him with a pale face.\n\n'Yeah, no. I don't know what Corsair's mission is, but I am not going to watch an innocent woman be tortured right in front of my eyes.'\n\nAt that moment, the Tyrant chuckled again.\n\n\"Well, no matter. As much as I'd love to test your limits, insolent fool, there is no time for that. So let me introduce you to my friend.\"\n\nSuddenly, a whirlwind of radiant sparks surrounded him. The whirlwind was too large to manifest into a Memoгy, which meant.\n\n'An Echo?'\n\nSuddenly, there was a sound of claws scraping against the floor.\n\nA grotesque creature appeared in the spacious room, towering above the humans. It was about three meters tall, with a gaunt torso and long, pale limbs. Its lower limbs were long and powerful, resembling that of a frog, while its upper limbs looked almost like that of a human - apart from their deathly pallor, eerie proportions, and clawed hands.\n\nThe truly appalling part was its face, though.\n\n'Ugh. Disgusting.'\n\nA mess of slithering tentacles hung from the creature's mouth, obscuring its chest. Its eyes were large and milky-white, covered by cataracts, and there were fin-like ridges crowning its head. The whole thing was moist and glistening dimly, as if the creature had just crawled from a dark pool of stagnant water.\n\nFrom what Rain could tell, it was an Echo of a Fallen Devil.\n\nThe Vault Keeper took an involuntary step back, while Corsair took a lazy step forward, which just so happened to put him between Rain and the Echo.\n\nCoincidentally, he almost bumped shoulders with Tamar, who had done the same.\n\n\"What what is this thing?\"\n\nThe Vault Keeper's voice was concerned.\n\nThe Tyrant craned his neck to look at his Echo, and then turned around to the woman.\n\n\"This is a uniquely persuasive Echo. Its powers affect the mind. Sadly, they also physically destroy the brain of the victim - but only after getting the victim to do what the master of the Echo needs. So, Vault Keeper, you have a choice. You can either get to know my friend better, or hand over a Memory called the Key of Ascension voluntarily.\"\n\nRain lowered her head and prepared to manifest her Mark into a weapon.\n\nAt that moment, however, something unexpected happened.\n\nJust as lazily as he had come between her and the Echo, Corsair took another step forward.\n\nAnd plunged a black stiletto into the back of the Tyrant's skull.\n\nOr rather, tried to.\n\nPeculiarly enough, the sharp blade simply slid off the man's head, only leaving a shallow scratch on it.\n\nTime seemed to slow down for a moment.\n\n'No what the hell? Time has literally slowed down?'\n\nCorsair sighed.\n\n\"Ray, now!\"\n\nAnd then, everything around them was suddenly plunged into darkness."

    "title": "2420 Uncharted Territory.docx",
    "content": "2420 Uncharted Territory\n\nA few minutes earlier, Ray rose from the floor and studied the four Awakened robbers guarding the hostages. His Dormant Aspect Ability did not make him invisible, but it did make him hard to notice - people and Nightmare Creatures both paid him littlе attention, and his presence was very subtle. Still, there was a limit to that Ability. He could take one of the bandits down, but unless he was careful, the rest would immediately notice it. Even if they did not notice Ray himself, they would see one of their own going down - his targets, after all, did not possess the same power.\n\n'Four of them.' Awakened were unpredictable and often possessed tricky Aspects, but usually, taking down four would not pose a problem to Ray - not after the training he had received in the Shadow Clan, at least. Taking them down quietly and while making sure that no hostage was harmed, however, was a different matter.\n\nHe glanced at the black blade in his hand, then sighed and placed it on the ground.\n\nA moment later, Ray was gone.\n\nIn seconds like these, his best friend was a distraction.\n\nNothing happened for a dozen seconds, and then, one of the hostages suddenly reeled back and screamed:\n\n\"S - snake! Snake!\"\n\nThe four robbers simultaneously turned to the source of the disturbance, aiming their rifles up. The man was awkwardly trying to crawl back, even though there was nothing in front of him.\n\nThe robbers looked at each other and then headed toward him.\n\nWell, three of them did, at least.\n\nThe one furthest away from the shouting hostage, and therefore behind the line of sight of his allies, suddenly found an arm wrapping around his neck. Ray got the man in a chokehold and squeezed with vicious strength, putting him to sleep. Since he made no noise whatsoever, and everyone's attention was focused on the frightened hostage, no one noticed him gently laying the unconscious robber on the floor.\n\nThe other three, meanwhile, reached their destination. They glanced at the pale hostage, and then, one of them said in an angry tone:\n\n\"Shut the hell up, moron. There's nothing here!\"\n\nThe hostage, however, shook his head.\n\n\"N - no! There was a snake here just a moment ago! I swear!\"\n\nThe robber sighed and opened his mouth to curse at the tied - up man.\n\nIt was then that a black snake suddenly slithered up his body and wrapped itself around his neck. Its mouth opened, and a chilling hiss resounded in the foyer.\n\n\"What the.\"\n\nThe other robbers were starting to raise their rifles, but just then, Ray appeared near one of them, bringing down an alloy pipe - which he had scavenged nearby - onto his head. The man toppled like a tree, and by the time his partner jerked the barrel of the rifle in that direction, there was no one there.\n\nRay's Awakened Ability, on the other hand, did allow him to become invisible - even if there were some limitations to that Ability, as well.\n\nIn any case, he only needed half a second to reach the remaining robber, this time. Ray ruthlessly kicked him in the stomach, grabbed his rifle to prevent it from accidentally going off, and then slammed his knee into the man's chin as he bent down from the initial blow. By then, his Mark had already dealt with the robber it had been strangling.\n\nAll four bandits were down, laying on the floor in motionless heaps.\n\nThe black snake slithered across the floor and climbed up his leg, disappearing into his sleeve a moment later.\n\nRay looked at the hostages, who were staring at him in shock and fear.\n\nHe remained still for a moment, then raised a hand and brought his index finger to his lips, as if telling them to be quiet.\n\nThen, he suddenly disappeared, leaving only four motionless bodies in his wake.\n\nNow, all he needed to do was get to the bank's grid control room and wait for Corsair's signal.\n\nFleur was also in the vault, and while Ray was not happy about being separated from her during a dangerous mission, he knew that she could fend for herself. His sweetheart was a healer, yes. but she had received the same training he did. Plus, Rain and Tamar were there as well.\n\n'Only I am stuck running boring chores.'\n\nSighing bitterly, he remembered the blueprints of the bank they had studied in advance and rushed to the grid control center.\n\n***\n\nJune listened to the exchange between the Vault Keeper and the Tyrant without showing any interest in it. Of course, in truth, he was following the conversation quite intently.\n\n'Six Awakened combatants, one Master.' The situation was not great, but it was not awful either.\n\nAs long as the Ascended was taken down rapidly, the rest were not going to pose a problem.\n\nOf course, June was not going to attack the enemy Master before learning what, exactly, had the man come here to steal.\n\nThen, the Tyrant went and summoned a Fallen Echo.\n\nThat spoiled June's mood somewhat, but not by much. Nothing really changed - quickly killing the leader of the zealots was still his primary goal. When the Tyrant died, his Echo would disappear with him. His first mission as a member of the Shadow Clan was truly quite precarious. June was supposed to learn what the cult was searching for and take the zealots down, despite the fact that their leader was an Ascended. At the same time, he had to make sure that the hostages weren't hurt or at least not hurt too badly.\n\nThe decision on how far the zealots were allowed to go was left to his discretion. Take the Vault Keeper, for example. Was he supposed to let the Tyrant torture her? Or would that be crossing the line?\n\nUsually, June would have had strict parameters for a job, but the Shadow Clan gave its members a lot of autonomy. He was not merely a hired gun anymore - he was expected to exercise his own judgment and make decisions that would benefit the clan of his own accord.\n\nWhich was already uncharted territory, and now there was also an unpredictable VIP added to the equation.\n\nThe princess. Worse still, the adversary was in possession of a Fallen Echo. The question of whether or not June would allow the Vault Keeper to be tortured was moot now - the Tyrant had decided to go straight for murder.\n\nThe murderous zealot, meanwhile, was speaking once again:\n\n\".So, Vault Keeper, you have a choice. You can either get to know my friend better, or hand over a Memory called the Key of Ascension voluntarily.\"\n\nJune smiled faintly behind the mask.\n\n'Ah, thank you kindly.'\n\nThe man just offered June the name of the Memory the cult was searching for. Which meant that June did not need him alive anymore.\n\nSuppressing his killing intent - some enemies were quite sensitive to it - June took a step forward while manifesting his Mark into a weapon and stabbed it into the Tyrant's skull.\n\nThere was no warning, no indication that he would attack. Just a rapid and ruthless strike that was supposed to end the zealot's life.\n\nBut that was the thing about fighting Awakened. Awakened were very hard to predict.\n\nThe second his weapon met the adversary's head, it felt as if he was trying to pierce metal. The bastard must have possessed a powerful defensive Aspect.\n\n'Well, crap.'\n\nJune activated his own Awakened Ability, slowing down time.\n\n\"Ray, now!\"\n\nSomewhere far away, Ray heard his voice through a special communication Memory shared between the three members of the team and cut the power.\n\nThe artificial lights, the video walls, the climate control systems, everything in the vault that needed power to function was immediately disabled, plunging the spacious room into utter darkness. And darkness was the territory of the Shadows."

    "title": "2421 In Slow Motion.docx",
    "content": "2421 In Slow Motion\n\nJune possessed quite a strange Aspect.\n\nHis Dormant Aspect Ability was subtle, but versatile and very useful - it made him exceptionally observant. His senses were sharper than those of most people, and he could discern many things that the rest would not notice. More than that, time seemed to slow down around him when he was focused or full of adrenaline - but that was merely an illusion. In truth, time flowed at its usual pace, and it was rather June's ability to perceive and assess his surroundings that outpaced it.\n\nIn other words, he saw the movements of his enemies in slow motion. June was moving just as slowly, since his speed was not given a corresponding boost - however, he had more time to perceive what his enemies were doing and come up with the best possible countermeasures.\n\nAdded to his already excellent observation skills and conditioning, that made him seem like someone with an impossibly quick reaction speed and insidiously keen judgment. As a side effect, June had earned a reputation of a man with ice flowing through his veins, since he never flinched and was never startled, remaining completely unfazed no matter what happened.\n\nHis Dormant Aspect Ability had saved his hide many times - it had always been powerful, and after years of specialized training, June learned to draw out its full potential.\n\nHis Awakened Aspect Ability, however, was anything but straightforward.\n\nIt allowed him to actually slow time down. Well, not quite. Rather, it allowed him to slow down things, people, and creatures. There was a catch, though. His Ability targeted an area instead of an entity - and within that area, different things were affected differently.\n\nThose more powerful than him would be slowed down less than those of equal power to his own, while those weaker than him would be slowed down more. Additionally, only their bodies would be affected, while their ability to perceive and assess information would remain the same. Inanimate objects and phenomena, meanwhile, were slowed down the most.\n\nJune was not immune to his own Ability, either, which meant that he had to use it cautiously and with foresight. He could cast it in front of himself to slow down a speeding bullet and step out of its path, for example, or to escape an explosion. But if he wanted to engage a powerful adversary in melee, slowing them both down would be the death of him - after all, he would be affected more than his foe.\n\nStill, once his backstab failed to kill the Tyrant, June plunged the entire vault into the mire of slowed time to give Ray enough time to cut the power.\n\nOnce darkness swallowed the entire bank, the Shadows received a decisive advantage against the enemy.\n\nJune made a sign, telegraphing his intent:\n\n[Tyrant.]\n\nAt the same time, Tamar of Sorrow made one, as well.\n\n[Echo.]\n\nIn the next moment, June deactivated his Awakened Ability, and the underground vault exploded into chaos.\n\n\"Corsaaaair!\"\n\nThe Tyrаnt's voice thundered in the darkness, full of murderous wrath and something else entirely. In fact, it was a full-blown sonic attack - luckily, June had already disappeared from his previous position, so he was not caught in the destructive shockwave.\n\nFleur dashed forward, grabbing the Vault Keeper and pushing her to the ground.\n\nTamar of Sorrow had already destroyed her restraints and exploded forward with breathtaking speed. The young woman seemed to step on air as she soared above the Fallen Devil - her Mark of Shadows assumed the form of a black greatsword, and she brought it down on the towering creature's detestable head with a spin.\n\nThe princess took a leisurely step to the side, putting the mass of the lumbering Echo between herself and the Awakened robbers, then opened her mouth as if to say something.\n\nThe zealots opened fire.\n\n'You absolute idiots!'\n\nJune wasted a whole fraction of a second to bemoan the lack of professional standards the wannabe outlaws were displaying. Who the hell fired blindly in a closed space? Sure, neither the Tyrant nor his Echo would be harmed by mundane bullets, but the six Awakened henchmen could easily shoot each other instead of their enemies. And indeed, none of the bullets hit their marks.\n\nFleur and the Vault Keeper were on the floor, Tamar of Sorrow was three metres above ground, Princess Rain was protected by the mass of the towering Echo, while June. June was protected by the Tyrant.\n\nThe Ascended zealot had already turned back, so a few bullets hit him in the back of the head, ricocheting away with metallic ringing.\n\n\"Stop firing, you.\"\n\nBefore he could finish the sentence, June crashed into him like a battering ram.\n\nHis goal right now was to separate the Tyrant from the rest of the Shadows and bring him as far away fгom the princess as possible. So, he grabbed the man and allowed momentum to carry them both in the direction of the nearest wall. They hit it with devastating force, breaking through - June had known all along that while the outer walls of the vault were heavily armored and even protected by runic sorcery, the ones separating the rooms inside were merely decorative. So, he and the Tyrant fell into the Vault Keeper's parlor in a rain of debris.\n\nAs they fell, June stabbed the Ascended man three times - one time in the neck, one time between the ribs, and one time in the inner thigh, hoping to cut at least one of the arteries.\n\nSadly, the Tyrant's entire body seemed to be protected by the mysterious Aspect Ability. June's black stiletto scraped harmlessly against the man's skin, failing to pierce it. Perhaps a more powerful weapon would have done the job, but June was an Awakened, and therefore, his Mark of Shadows was only as powerful as an Awakened weapon would have been.\n\n'Blast it.'\n\nUsually, summoning Memories would have been a bad decision in this situation - not only because Memories took time to manifest, but also because they came into existence as whirlwinds of radiant sparks. Members of the Shadow Clan thrived in darkness, though, so illuminating themselves in such a manner was unwise. That was why the Memories forged for them by the Lord of Shadows manifested from strings of darkness, instead. Some of them - weapons in particular - could be summoned instantly, as well.\n\nSadly, June found himself unable to summon Memories. The world seemed to slow down as he came to terms with the sudden revelation, contemplated possible reasons, and came to a probable conclusion. 'Huh.'\n\nIt seemed like the enchanted restraints placed on Awakened hostages were not enchanted at all. Rather, they were merely meant to mask someone's Aspect Ability.\n\nThe Tyrant's Aspect Ability, most likely. The man could suppress the flow of essence, thus interfering with the Aspect Abilities of other Awakened and preventing them from summoning Memories.\n\nSo, what was June supposed to do if his weapon could not pierce the Ascended zealot's flesh, and he could not summon a different blade?\n\nThe Tyrant's mask had been destroyed by the sonic attack, revealing his chiseled face. He opened his mouth, beginning to saу something. It had the potential to be a taunt or another sonic blast. Having considered his options, June swung his fist and punched the Master in the face."

    "content": "2422 Shadows VS Zealots, Fight\n\nStriking the Tyrant with a fist felt like striking armored alloy. which was not too bad, since June had had the unfortunate experience of ripping from an APC or two with his bare hands before.\n\nNo matter how strong an Ascended was, they were still beholden to the laws of physics. The Tyrant was thrown down, the back of his head cracking the floor. Before he could recover, June struck him again, and then again, and again.\n\nHis arms moved like pistons, his fists falling down like hydraulic power hammers. He could not stab the enemy to death, so blunt force trauma and concussive force were the next best thing - June put as much strength as he could muster into each punch, making sure not to shatter his own bones in the process.\n\nBeing a member of the Shadow Clan was not without its perks, but there were drawbacks as well, possibly the most significant of them was that servants of the Dark Lord did not belong to the Flame Domain anymore, and were therefore devoid of Changing Star's grace. Miraculous flames were not going to descend to soothe their pain and heal their wounds, so they always had to be cautious.\n\nMore cautious than those who walked in the light were, at least.\n\n'Come. on!'\n\nThe Tyrant seemed a little dazed, but not at all as hurt as June had hoped he would be. Worse still, the man was already coming to his senses. There was blood pouring from his nose and from his mouth, where a tooth or two must have been dislodged, but his eyes had regained their murderous glint. Three moments had already passed since the moment the power was cut, even if it felt like much longer. That meant that things were about to get far more difficult for the Shadows.\n\nIt took some time to summon Memories, but those of them that produced light were usually the simplest and weakest of them, which meant that they could be summoned rapidly. If even one of the zealots had reacted quickly, the darkness that gave June and his people a decisive advantage could be dispelled at any moment.\n\nBut June had to concentrate on the Tyrant. Now that the man had regained his senses, trying to crack his skull with a barrage of blows was not an option anymore - engaging a Master in hand - to - hand combat was a dangerous idea at the best of times, but trying to grapple one was pure suicide.\n\nSo, June disengaged and jumped back, activating his Awakened Ability once again to slow the Tyrant down. His essence felt sluggish, but his control of it was refined enough to break through the unknown hex. The Ascended zealot still moved with a speed that left June appalled, jumping to his feet and summoning a whirlwind of spаrks to illuminate his surroundings.\n\nTo June, the innumerable sparks seem to drift slowly through the air. He studied his adversary.\n\nThe Tyrant was older than he had assumed, his unshaven face pale and harsh. His equipment was mundane, offering no additional protection. Being stabbed, shot in the back of the head, slammed thгough a wall, and repeatedly punched in the face did not seem to have affected him in any significant manner.\n\nBlood flowing from his nose and his mouth was going to compromise his breathing, though. The man was left - handed, but his right eye was the dominant one. He also protected his left side slightly, most likely subconsciously, hinting at an old wound that was still letting itself be known, or at least a psychological habit. Not much to work with.\n\nJune sighed, deactivated his Awakened Aspect Ability, and lunged forward.\n\nOutside the devastated parlor, numerous things had happened in these three long moments.\n\nThe Fallen Devil had lost half of its tentacle and was pushed to the corner of the rоom by Tamar's fierce assault. Her black greatsword was a Memory forged for her by Sunny himself - its enchantments were quite perplexing, making the brutish weapon exponentially deadlier the faster its wielder was moving and granting it far greater power if the wielder was completely airborne, not touching the ground at all. That and the element of surprise allowed Tamar to push the towering Echo back. Now, however, the Devil had regained its wits and was about to launch a counterattack.\n\nRain, meanwhile, had used the first second to assign herself an Epithet. As an Awakened, she could maintain two at the same time, so she granted the same Epithet to Fleur, too.\n\nIt was quite a easy one.\n\n\"Fleur, now!\"\n\nAs the Vault Keeper pressed herself into the floor, the two young women rushed toward the robbers. The darkness was only broken by the muzzle flashes and ethereal glow of swirling sparks of light, so the enemies could not really aim at them. Still, six automatic rifles produced a lot of bullets.\n\nRain was hit in the shoulder. Despite the Epithet she had assigned herself, she was not entirely bulletproof. A direct strike from a heavy railgun would have probably punched right through her body. She would not have been able to protect a mundane person from being killed by less destructive firearms, either - after all, it was not in the nature of mundane people to be immune to bullets.\n\nBut she was an Awakened instead. Awakened did possess some measure of resistance to mundаne weapons, so the Epithet she had given herself did not have to fundamentally change her nature. It simply had to enhance a quality that she already possessed, so the effect was more than potent enough to allow her to shrug off the hit and continue to move forward as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe same held true for Fleur, even if the Epithet assigned to her wаs not tied to a True Name, and was therefore less effective.\n\nBoth of them reached the zealots in one piece. What happened next was quite predictable. Rain and Fleur were exceptionally skilled Awakened warriors with fully saturated cores and rich, harrowing experience of fighting a war in Godgrave under their belts. More than that, they could see in the dark, while their enemies could not.\n\nThe only difficulty was that Rain could not kill their opponents, and had to subdue them while keeping everyone alive instead. The robbers were already summoning luminous Memories, as well.\n\nAnd yet, none of them managed to benefit from that light.\n\nBy the time the first lantern manifested itself into existence, all six assailants were already either dead or unconscious. Rain and Fleur had bulldozed through them at breathtaking speed, moving as quickly and subtly as real shadows would.\n\nAll in all, it took them no more than six moments. And on the seventh second.\n\nTamar hissed, stepping on air to push herself back. The Echo still managed to reach her with its claws, sending the young woman rolling across the floor. At the same time, Corsair was tossed through the broken wall - instead of crushing into the ground, however, he spun and landed on his feet, regaining his balance a split second later with an inexplicable level of nonchalance.\n\nThe Tyrant and his Echo faced the three Shadows, sending a shiver running down Rain's spine.\n\n'I think. I better think of something quick?'"

    "content": "2423 Silence is Golden\n\nThe Tyrant walked out of the ruined parlor like a sinister spirit, three luminous Memories igniting above his shoulders and above his head like three eyes of a furious monster. His black fatigues were covered in dust, and his face was smeared in blood. His glassy eyes were gleaming with cold, murderous wrath.\n\nWalking over to stand side by side with his Echo, he glanced at the three Shadows darkly. The Vault Keeper moved to stand behind them, shielding her eyes from the bright light. Four Awakened against a Master and аn Echo of a Fallen Devil.\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n'Should we stall to give Ray an opportunity to get down here?'\n\nRain hesitated for a moment. She did not know the plan of Corsair's team, but was pretty sure that Ray had dealt with the four henchmen the robbers had left to guard the hostages by now. The young man was not the most formidable fighter of their cohort, but he was its hidden weapon - he was exceptionally lethal, often striking from the shadows to bring down enemies much morе powerful than him. However, the Tyrant's potent defensive Aspect Ability would make it hard for Ray to kill him in a single strike.\n\nMore than that, they would have to engage the Ascended man in conversation to stall for time. And Rain had a feeling that letting the Tyrant talk would be a big mistake. 'What to do?'\n\nCorsair shifted slightly, taking something off his belt. Rain's eyes widened slightly when she recognized what the tall man was gripping in both hands. 'G - grenades?' What was he planning to do? And what kind of Awakened carried grenades around, anyway? She had only seen them in movies before.\n\nCorsair seemed to smile chillingly behind his devilish mask.\n\nTamar raised her greatsword slightly, preparing to dash forward.\n\nFleur braced herself, shielding the Vault Keeper with her body. The Tyrant opened his mouth. And froze in confusion, failing to make a sound.\n\nWell, naturally he failed.\n\nAfter all, Rain had assigned him an Epithet just then. The Tyrant became the Mute Tyrant. 'Ouch.'\n\nForcefully placing an Epithet on an unwilling Ascended was difficult, strenuous, and burned through her essence with dire speed on top of that. The sinister Master would most likely shake the effects off in a moment or two - but that was alright.\n\nBecause Rain was not done yet. She wanted to try something else, as well. Turning to the Echo, she concentrated and Named it, turning it from a nameless Echo into the Gross Friend of the Mute Tyrant. And then, she assigned an Epithet to the Echo, connecting it to the given Name.\n\nThis one was quite easy, and did not go against the nature of the Echo at all - in fact, it was reliant on its nature. Just like that, the Gross Friend of the Mute Tyrant became the Dismissed Gross Friend of the Mute Tyrant.\n\n'Be gone!'\n\nRain poured her essence and willpower into the Epithet, praying that this unconventional application of her Aspect would work. And did it.\n\nA second later, the Echo exploded into a whirlwind of sparks, pouring back into the Tyrant's soul. \"Attack!\"\n\nThe gross Echo was not destroyed, merely dismissed. So, the Ascended bandit could easily summon it again - it would take some time to manifest the grotesque Devil for the second time, though. They had to finish the Tyrant before that happened.\n\nThe sinister Master was, without a doubt, surprised by the sudden vanishing of his Echo. The Shadows, however, were accustomed to all kinds of strange and inexplicable things - after all, they came from the Dark City, wherе the Lord of Shadows reigned. Rain's brother was a weirdo to put all other weirdos to shame. If he proclaimed himself to be the second most bizarre person in the world - two worlds, even - no one would dare to claim the first place. So, they reacted instantly.\n\nTamar exploded forward, turning into a blur. Corsair was not far behind, with Rain and Fleur following. Four black weapons were aimed at the Tуrant's vital points. Well, Rain aimed a little off the mark, knowing that she would not be able to strike him where it counted. However, even caught by surprise, a Master was still a Master.\n\nThe Tyrant moved with awful speed, evading Tamar despite her Awakened Ability. In the next moment, his hands shot forward to grab her neck - then, both of them slowed down, as if caught in a mire. The Tyrant was reaching toward Tamar, who was evading away. Her hair fluttered in the wind, rippling slowly. Her hands shifted slowly on the hilt of the black greatsword, pushing and pulling to turn its colossal blade around. The blade was mere centimeters away from the Ascended bandit's torso, but at the speed it was moving, he would not be cut any time soon.\n\nThen, Corsair slammed into the Tyrant, throwing them both back. Time resumed its usual flow, and the two men hit the floor a dozen metres away from the rest of them. Something rang as it rolled on the floor. Those were the safety pins of the grenades.\n\nRain's eyes widened. \"You insane?\"\n\nAt the last moment, Corsair managed to push himself away, sliding back across the floor. Still.\n\nWhen the grenades detonated, he was no more than a couple of meters away from the explosion.\n\nThe Tyrant was suddenly enveloped in light and flame. The flame, the shrapnel, the shockwave moved slowly, however, blooming in all directions like a peculiar, gorgeous, radiant flower. Corsair was right in front of the slowly exploding ring of fire and shrapnel, his kneeling figure countered against it sharply. \".bastard!\"\n\nSomething moved within the flame.\n\nA Master was not going to be killed by a couple of mundane grenade, naturally. He was not even going to be seriously hurt by them. Unless Rain got involved.\n\nDismissing the \"Mute\" Epithet, she assigned two new ones to the Slow, Combustible Tyrant. Then, she opened her mouth.\n\nAnd spoke the True Name of Fire."

    "content": "2424 The Word is Mightier than a Grenade\n\nThe flames suddenly grew in intensity, and a wave of unbearable heat washed over the bank vault. The figure imprisoned in the slowly blooming explosion shuddered and convulsed, a strangely distorted scream reaching Rain's ears.\n\nShe knew that the Tyrant was not going to be killed by the flames. The very fact that she had been able to speak the Name of Fire proved it - her Flaw would have prevented her from channeling it otherwise. However, he would definitely be hurt by the explosion. a lot.\n\nNot only was the Tyrant more susceptible to being burned because of the Epithet she had assigned him, but her other Epithet synergized with Corsair's Aspect, slowing the burning Master down even more.\n\nThe man himself rolled away from the explosion, escaping it entirely. Jumping to his feet near Rain, she gazed at her with his piercing blue eyes and said evenly from under his monstrous mask:\n\n\".I thought you were a pacifist?\"\n\nRain smiled radiantly.\n\n\"I am!\"\n\nWith that, she turned to the burning Master and dismissed the Combustible Epithet, replacing it with another one.\n\nHyperalgesic.\n\nExtremely sensitive to pain.\n\nRain was not going to admit why she even knew that word, but she did. And as a result, the peculiarly distorted scream turned into a strangely distorted howl.\n\nCorsair stared at her with his calm blue eyes. But. Did Rain imagine it, or had the tall man shivered faintly?\n\nSurely, it was just her imagination.\n\nSome time later, the commotion was over.\n\nThe robbers - who had turned out to be zealots - were unconscious and restrained. The badly burned corpse of the Tyrant was covered by a sheet. Rain had not killed him, naturally. Like thе peaceful and harmless person that she was, she simply made him wail and convulse in agony while Tamar and Corsair finished the job.\n\nShe had suggested sparing the murderous zealot and merely knocking him out, even, but Corsair had other ideas. She could understand his decision, as well - the Awakened criminals were already difficult to contain, but imprisoning an unhinged Master demanded a wealth of resources the government did not possess.\n\nThe government was barely holding the world from falling apart as it was. In any case, the lockdown was lifted from the bank. Corsair, Ray, and Fleur disappeared without a trace, while Rain and Tamar stayed behind to have a talk with the government forces. Tamar's status as a Legacy and a former centurion of the Seventh Royal Legion would come in handy to explain how a dozen Awakened criminals and an Ascended mastermind ended in their current pitiful state.\n\nAfter checking on the hostages and releasing them from the restraints, the two of them walked outside. As they waited for the police to arrive in front of the bank's doors, Rain glanced around, her gaze lingering on the graffiti marring the walls for a moment.\n\nShe sighed. NQSC had really changed. In the past, there would not have been graffiti in such a prestigious district. Especially one lacking any artistic value. just a mess of letters drawn in faded paint.\n\nThere would not have been crazed zealots robbing banks, either. She glanced at Tamar.\n\n\"Hey. We did not just happen to be in that bank by accident, did we?\"\n\nTamar gave her an impassive stare.\n\nEventually, though, she shrugged.\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\nRain raised a hand and flicked her on the forehead.\n\n\"I knew it! Why, though? Don't get me wrong, I do not mind foiling a bank robbery. Actually, it was kind of exciting. But I am so busy today - I have to speak in front of a large crowd in an hour!\"\n\nShe made a pitiful face. Tamar looked at her, remained silent for a few seconds, then sighed.\n\n\"Your brother is preoccupied at the moment. So, Aiko asked me to evaluate Corsair's performance and back his team up if necessary. Granted. she probably did not expect that I'd take you with me.\"\n\nRain chuckled.\n\n\"So why did you?\"\n\nTamar glanced at her with the usual stern frown.\n\n\"I mean. you're kind of hard to get rid of, you know?\"\n\nA rare smile illuminated her face, and she glanced away.\n\n\"Plus, I wanted you to see Corsair in action and get your opinion. I am assembling a cohort to challenge the Second Nightmare, you know. I had my eye on him, but needed to make sure that he'll fit.\"\n\nRain smiled, as well.\n\n\"And what do you think? Will he fit?\"\n\nTamar nodded.\n\n\"Sure. Asterion will fit just fine.\"\n\nRain blinked.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nHad she heard wrong?\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\nTamar looked at her in confusion.\n\n\"I said that Corsair will fit just fine. Why?\"\n\nRain tilted her head a little.\n\n\"Ah. I think you misspoke.\"\n\nShe pointed to the wall.\n\n\"That graffiti must have been on your mind, huh?\"\n\nThere, someone had written in large, bold letters:\n\nAS TE RI ON.\n\n\"What's an asterion, anyway?\"\n\nTamar studied the graffiti for a moment, as if noticing it only now, then frowned and shook her head.\n\n\"No idea. Sounds a bit familiar, I guess?\"\n\nSomewhere far away, sirens broke the silence. Rain patted Tamar on the shoulder.\n\n\"Well. you'll deal with it. I have an academic report to make.\"\n\nTurning around, she began to walk away. The strange word got stuck in her mind, repeating itself like an earworm:\n\n'Asterion, asterion. as - te - ri - on.'\n\n***\n\nIn a hallway in Ravenheart, Sunny stopped and leaned on the wall.\n\nHe had just remembered receiving a report about the bank robbery, and Rain's participation in it.\n\n'She did what?'\n\n\"Rain. cooked a Master alive?!\"\n\nAlive being the key word.\n\nAnd she had forcefully dismissed an Echo, too. Apparently, that was something his sister was capable of, now. According to the report, she had been inspired to try something like that after seeing the cooked Master's Aspect Ability, which allowed him to prevent Awakened from summoning Memories.\n\nIf someone could interfere with summoning Memories, why wouldn't someone be able to interfere with dismissing them?\n\n\"No, but why the hell is she going around getting into fights with Masters, in the first place?\"\n\nHe had turned away for a minute. not even that!\n\nOne - seventh of him had turned away. Sunny huffed and puffed, angry that Rain had been put in the position where she had to face a hostile Ascended. And with barely anyone. except for four elite agents of the Shadow Clan. present to protect her!\n\n'What have I assigned Quentin to Bastion for? Could he not have followed her to NQSC?'\n\nShaking his head, Sunny continued walking.\n\n'I need to have a serious talk with Aiko about that incident.'\n\nBut just then, another memory from the past few weeks surfaced in his mind.\n\nSunny froze, then let out a hollow laugh.\n\n\"What. what did Aiko do?\""

    "title": "2425 Aikos Day Off.docx",
    "content": "2425 Aiko's Day Off\n\nAiko studied the sky thoughtfully.\n\nThe sky was vast, blue, and full of sunlight. White clouds were drifting across its peaceful azure expanse like cotton candy, carried by warm winds.\n\nShe was pleased.\n\n'Ah, finally!'\n\nIt was nice to see the light of day again after spending so long on the Forgotten Shore. The starless void of its orphaned sky was black and cold, with not even a moon to keep it company. Poor thing! The land itself was devoid of warmth and light, as well - it was quiet and tranquil, but not exactly vibrant.\nSo, visiting Bastion was something Aiko had been looking forward to very much.\n\nNot the least of all because people could actually appreciate her stylish outfit here. Members of the Shadow Clan could see in the dark, true, but they had trouble discerning colors - everything was a shade of grey for them. Most could not tell silk from satin, either, let alone appreciate the nuances of exquisite fashion.\n\nNow that Aiko was finally wealthy enough to afford the finer things of life, leaving her wonderful ensembles unappreciated was a despicable crime.\n\nFeeling fierce and invincible in her white silk blouse, black skirt, flawlessly fitted vest, and tastefully embroidered blazer, she walked dоwn the streets of the Castle with determined steps. Her sharp heels sang as they strike the cobblestones, and her hair fluttered in the wind.\n\nAll items of her ensemble were bespoke. The vest and the blazer were detailed tastefully with silver thread, which added to the subtle gleam of silver buttons and cufflinks - the latter set with onyx gemstones. Her shoes were made from lacquered black leather, with large silver buckles creating а fascinating contrast with the dainty black bоws above.\n\nAiko chose not to wear any jewelry, knowing that it would only cheapen her look - well, except for a few charms hidden under her blouse for protection.\n\nShe looked sophisticated, she looked chic. And most importantly, she looked exceedingly affluent! Anyone who knew anything would recognize just how exorbitantly expensive each item of her stylish ensemble was. Those who knew a thing or two about fashion, meanwhile, would be amazed to recognize the subdued cut of her outfit for what it was.\n\nThe ensemble Aiko wore was not just any random arrangement of complementary clothes. It was actually a tasteful reimagining of the suit Morgan of Valor had worn to the last ever Valor Ball, designed and sewn by the same tailor - who was supposed to have retired after the fall of the Sword Domain.\n\nThat was why it had cost Aiko a fortune.\n\n'Worth it!'\n\nShe grinned, almost missing a large puddle in front of her. Her shoe was about to touch the dirty water when the petite girl floated into the air, gliding gracefully to the dry cobblestones on the other side.\n\nLanding softly, she turned back and smiled triumphantly.\n\n\"Not today, puddle!\"\n\nIgnoring the stares of the passersby, she raised her chin and continued on her way with confident - albeit quite modest in length - strides.\n\nReaching one of the inner walls of the Castle, Aiko floated to the battlements instead of passing through a nearby gate. Standing there, she enjoyed the view of the glistening lake and of the great city beyond.\n\nBastion had grown tremendously since the first time she saw it. Back then, when Aiko was a youth who had just escaped the Forgotten Shore, there was not even a city on the shores of the lake - every Awakened sheltered by the Great Citadel, including her and Kai, lived within the Castle. There was nothing but ash and Nightmare Creatures waiting for them beyond its walls.\n\nThings were different now, naturally. Bastion sprawled around the lake, with no end in sight - the city was vast and immense, sheltering close to a hundred million peoрle. Unlike the claustrophobic cities of Earth, which endlessly grew upward or burrowed into the ground to stay within the narrow confines of defensive barriers, it stretched in all directions freely.\n\nThe buildings of Bastion were relatively low - not only because building towering human hives in the Dream Realm, where most of modern technology turned useless, was all but impossible unless sorcery or people with powerful Utility Aspects were involved, but also because there was no need to build them high.\n\nAiko liked it better. She liked looking up and not feeling crushed by the looming mass of alloy and concrete. Or crimson coral, and breathing in the vastness of the sky with a full chest.\n\nNaturally, sustaining a city of such size in the Dream Realm was no easy task. In fact, the rate with which Bastion had sprouted from the ash was nothing short of impossible - if not for the innumerable Awakened working day and night to build homes for the refugees of Antarctica and new settlers, none of it would have been here.\n\nThe city was at capacity at tearing at the seams, though. These days, most of the settlers were channeled to other Citadels across the vast reaches of the former Sword Domain, while those in the west traveled along the River of Tears to settle down in one of the human strongholds situated in its basin.\n\nThere were innumerable problems to be solved in Bastion. It was all boiling and changing, taking form and crumbling, always one step away from complete collapse.\n\nWhich meant that there were innumerable opportunities to be reaped.\n\nAiko was not the same youth anymore, either. She had changed, too. She had gone from running a gambling den in the Bright Castle to running the entirety of the Dark City, as well as the powerful shadow organization dwelling there.\n\n'Naturally, there's the Boss, but let's be honest here. That walking calamity can't even manage himself. I mean, how did he manage to lose one of his incarnations? Who does that? Who has incarnations, and who goes around losing them?'\n\nAiko scoffed and prepared to glide off the wall.\n\nAt that moment, however, a polite voice interrupted her:\n\n\"Excuse me, my lady. Flying is forbidden in the inner rings of the city.\"\n\nTurning her head, Aiko tried to look at the Awakened guards who had approached her while patrolling the wall. Sadly, she had to crane her neck to actually look them in the eye.\n\nSo, instead, she floated up until she cоuld look down at them snobbishly.\n\n\"Good to know, thank you. However, I am obviously floating, not flying.\"\n\nThe guard who had spoken to her blinked.\n\n\"What is the difference?\"\n\nAiko gave him a confused look and did not respond immediately, as if stunned into silence by the question.\n\nEventually, she said:\n\n\"Velocity. Velocity is the difference.\"\n\nShe floated with the help of the Awakened Ability, and pushed herself with the help of her Dormant Ability. So, her speed had never been too great.\n\nThe guards looked at each other. The other one shook his head.\n\n\"No, as stated by the regulations regarding unconventional spatial movement, flying is constituted by aerial movement with the help of a self-generated directional force, while floating and gliding are constituted by the lack of said directional force. You were obviously flying, my lady. I am deeply sorry, but we will have to fine you. It is really a small sum.\"\n\nAiko smiled dangerously.\n\n\"Oh? Well, in that case, by all means, over my dead body.\"\n\nThey wanted to fine her?\n\nIn their dreams!\n\nThe guards stared at her with lost expressions.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nAiko crossed her arms haughtily. \"Do you even know who I am?\"\n\nThey studied her expensive outfit for a few seconds, then frowned.\n\n\"No, we don't. We have no idea. But what does that.\"\n\nAiko smiled radiantly.\n\n\"Wonderful!\"\n\nWith that, she allowed the wind to carry her over the lip of the wall and glided rapidly toward the crowds of people below. After all, since they had no idea who she was, they would not be able to find her in the city of a hundred million people.\n\nThe guards were so shocked that they were a second too late to react.\n\n\"Hey, wait a moment!\"\n\nBut Aiko was already gone, enjoying the gorgeous boon of anonymity.\n\n'Directional force, directional force. Bah, how silly! As if I'll allow myself to lose money over something like that.'"

    "content": "2426 The Fine Nuances of Printing Money\n\nBastion was too vast now to travel across it on foot - granted, Aiko's destination was not far from the lakeshore. Leaving the ferry, she thought about hailing a carriage, but then stumbled upon a shop window and became enthralled, staring at the displayed items with gleaming eyes.\n\nIt occurred to Aiko that she had made a terrible mistake when choosing her outfit. Living in the darkness of the Dark City must have messed up with her fashion sense, after all. She had gotten so used to only seeing the world in shades of gray that she neglected to add a splash of color to her ensemble! 'Ah, what an oversight!'\n\nAiko was utterly mortified.\n\n'That red scarf. those ruby cufflinks. those shoes with scarlet soles!'\n\nNo, no. She couldn't. After all, her outfit was an homage to the criminally underappreciated icon of fashion, Morgan of Valor herself - not a shameless imitation. Morgan had those breathtaking vermilion eyes, which held the entire ensemble together. That was why her outfits went well with red accents and ruby accessories!\n\nAiko, sadly, did not have vermilion eyes. Her eyes were brown, so.\n\n'Blue? Green? No, those won't go well with silver. Pink? How about purple?'\n\nShе glared at the store window, almost burning a hole in it.\n\nIn the past, when Aiko was poor and destitute - long before her Awakening, even - she had spent many hours in front of shop windows like this one, staring at gorgeous things that she knew would only be hers in her fantasies.\n\nBut now, she was not one for window shopping.\n\nWhy stare at windows when she could buy anything she wanted in the shop, or even buy the shop itself?\n\nWalking inside the boutique, she gave the staff a neutral look. The professionals immediately evaluated her clothes, accessories, and general appearance. A moment later, their expressions changed, and bright smiles illuminated their faces.\n\n\"My lady! Welcome!\"\n\nAiko allowed a corner of her mouth to curl upward.\n\n'Ah. Being rich is really the best.'\n\nThen, she raised her hand and pointed to a shelf.\n\n\"This. And this. And this one, as well. Also that one, and that one, and that one over there.\"\n\nShe lost track of time. After a while, a mountain of colorful boxes was in front of her, and the smiles of the staff grew so wide that their faces were on the verge of cracking.\n\n\"That would be one hundred coins, my lady.\"\n\nAiko produced her coin purse, untied it, and emptied it onto the counter.\n\nThe clerk's eyes glinted sharply.\n\nHers did, as well. Now came the important part: haggling!\n\nOf course, as civilized and refined people, they were not going to haggle over the price of purchased items.\n\nInstead, they had to haggle over the price of her money.\n\nAiko pointed to her coins.\n\n\"As you can see, these are prime-condition Ravenheart coins. So, I am willing to pay fifty of those.\"\n\nThe clerk smiled pleasantly.\n\n\"Ah, but the quality of recently minted Ravenheart coins is not as superior as it used to be. Even if it was, surely, they would not be twice as valuable. Possibly a tenth more valuable, at best. I am very sorry to say this, my lady, but I can't surrender these gorgeous things to you for less than ninety of these coins.\"\n\nCoins minted in Bastion and Ravenheart were supposed to be identical, containing a set amount of soul essencе. But the way they were minted and infused with essence was not completely precise. Different mints, and even different batches from the same mint, produced faintly different results. Ravenheart coins were generally more valuable, although that too depended on numerous factors.\n\nAiko raised her hand and shook a finger.\n\n\"Oh, but your eyesight must not be sharp. It seems that you failed to notice that these coins over there are not merely Ravenheart coins. They are in fact Song Domain coins in pristine condition. Come to think of it, I think I failed to notice that as well. My, how silly of me! So, I am willing to part with forty of these gorgeous coins.\"\n\nThe clerk's face paled in fear.\n\nHow did fifty coins turn into forty? Wasn't she supposed to increase the price, instead?\n\nWorst of all, he could not even dispute this tiny girl's logic.\n\nApart from the coins minted in Bastion and Ravenheart these days, there also remained coins minted by the fallen Song and Sword Domains. Their quality was not that superior to the modern coinage - in fact, it was inferior in most regards. And yet, they were quite a bit more valuable, for no other reason than that they were much rarer.\n\nSince the two Domains had only minted money for a few years before disappearing into the annals of history, there would never be a new batch of Song and Sword coins produced by humans. Their number was limited, and rapidly plummeting - after all, essence coins could be consumed to get a boost of essence in a difficult situation. So, their rarity alone inflated their value.\n\nPeople were peculiar creatures that way, seeing value in things that lacked it simply because other people would not be able to possess them, as well.\n\nThe clerk gulped.\n\n\"F - forty? N - no, I couldn't. After all, we are all Bastion natives here. Those pesky Song coins are not welcomed here?\"\n\nHis voice did not sound confident.\n\nAiko smiled triumphantly.\n\n\"Money doesn't stink, you know. But actually. I bet carrying all these coins would be cumbersome for you. How about I pay with something else?\"\n\nSuddenly, a different coin appeared between her fingers. That one was larger and heavier, entirely black, and etched with a symbol of a coiled serpent.\n\nThe clerk's eyes widened drastically.\n\n\"Is that a shadow coin?\"\n\nHe reached forward with a trembling hand.\n\nAiko grinned, retracting her own.\n\n\"Indeed, it is. So, how about I pay with only one?\"\n\nThe clerk hesitated for a few seconds.\n\nIf the old Domain coins were valuable, then Shadow Coins were extremely so. Nobody knew where they came from and who was minting them, but everyone wanted to possess one - that was because they were not essence coins.\n\nInstead, they were fragment coins. Consuming them did not grant Awakened essence, and instead granted them a soul fragment - or even a few, if the coin was of a high denomination.\n\nOf course, there were easier ways to obtain soul fragments. Purchasing a soul shard, for example, was far more attainable than hunting down the elusive shadow coins. But it was exactly that elusiveness, that mystique, and that great rarity that made them true treasures.\n\nThe Shadow Coins, of course, were produced by the Dark Castle - the Marvelous Mimic - and did not cost Aiko anything. All she had to do to get them was keep the Mimic on a steady diet of distressing Nightmare Creatures, which was a great way to make money out of thin air.\n\nThe clerk accepted the coin with greed in his eyes and forced out a polite smile.\n\n\"Wonderful, my lady. Please visit our establishment again. Oh, do you need help carrying the boxes to your carriage?\"\n\nAiko grinned.\n\n\"No need.\"\n\nSummoning a gorgeous purse crafted from black leather, she opened it and placed the first box inside. The box was larger than the purse, and yet, it disappeared without a trace.\n\nThe second box did, as well. And the third. And the fourth.\n\nBefore too long, the mountain of boxes vanished completely.\n\nTying a vibrant cravat around her neck, Aiko smiled in satisfaction.\n\n\"Well, then. Goodbye!\"\n\nWith that, she dismissed the purse and left the shop in complete exhilaration.\n\nOf course, she did not forget to gather her coins from the counter first.\n\n'Now. I'm off to see Effie!'"

    "title": "2427 Transportation Situation.docx",
    "content": "2427 Transportation Situation\n\nAiko was in a great mood as she hailed a carriage, which was her preferred method of moving around Bastion. Moving around Bastion was somewhat of a complicated matter, actually. There was already a grand project in the works to simplify it - special tramways meant for street cars were being embedded into the main streets, strengthened by primitive sorcery. The rails were cast from a special alloy that allowed them to channel essence, while the trams themselves were enchanted to move by absorbing it.\n\nNow that the Rivergate Hydro had gone operational, though, there were talks of discarding the magical street cars in favor of good old-fashioned electric trams. Aiko suspected that, in the end, both types were going to be implemented, with enchanted tramways serving as the thoroughfares of the public transport network while more mundane ones would branch out from them as satellite outlets. The first street car was supposed to be launched quite soon.\n\nBefore that happened, though, citizens of Bastion had six main ways to get around the city. The first one was to use a ferry and cross the lake. Naturally, that could only get one to a different location on the lakeshore - however, considering that the city surrounded the lake like a ring, it was often faster to travel by water before continuing on foot than to make the entire journey while never leaving the land.\n\nThe second way was the simplest - it was to use your own two feet. However, Bastion was an enormous city, so one could literally walk for days without ever reaching their destination in case they needed to travel to a distant part of the city. Naturally, Awakened hаd a great advantage over mundane humans in that regard, but even they would be hard-pressed to simply walk everywhere.\n\nThe third way was much faster, albeit somewhat inconvenient. It was to hire an Awakened rickshaw - those came in all shapes and forms, from individual or two-seat carts to heavy wagons capable of carrying a dozen or more passengers. Their speed and capacity depended entirely on the puller's personal strength, and while most Awakened sought better opportunities, some saw owning a rickshaw as a safe way to make modest amounts of money.\n\nThe fourth way was a more comfortable, luxurious, and prestigious version of the third - it was to hire a carriage pulled by an Echo. There was no Beastmaster in Bastion, and therefore no army of enthralled abominations to serve as the engine of civil infrastructure. So, Echoes were the next best thing. Sadly, despite the fact that there were numerous times more Awakened in the world these days, most of whom were waging war against the Dream Realm on numerous fronts, there were still not enough Echoes out there to make this mode of transportation widely accessible.\n\nOnly affluent people had the means to hire an Echo carriage. Luckily, Aiko was one such person. So, she preferred to hail a carriage, even if there was a faster way to get to where she was going.\n\nThat faster way was to ride an Echo mount. Not all Awakened had Echoes, and even fewer had Echoes that could be ridden as mounts - however, owning one was quickly becoming the epitome of class, prestige, and flare. It was to the point that impressive Echo mounts were not only widely sought after, but also cost more than powerful combat beasts at times. Owning an especially impressive mount could make an Awakened famous and admired by the masses in an instant.\n\nAiko could probably get herself a pretty, stylish, and utterly magnificent Echo mount or two, but she did not like riding them at all. Why would she want to toss and rattle on the back of a towering beast? Not only would that ruin her masterfully tousled hair by actually tousling it - the horror! - but it would also wrinkle her clothes, not to mention limiting her wardrobe. 'Thanks, but no thanks!'\n\nThe last way of getting around Bastion was quite peculiar and, strangely enough, in competition with personal Echo mounts in terms of convenience. Not only that, but it was easily accessible to every citizen, Awakened or not. That method was riding a bicycle.\n\nBicycles were not very complicated machines, so nothing prevented them from being used in the Dream Realm. Citizens of Bastion had developed a great appreciation for bicycles, actually - most were still imported from the waking world, but some were already being crafted right here in the city. Aiko would know, since she had invested heavily into bicycle manufacturing herself. She had invested in innumerable enterprises around Bastion, actually, but the bicycle business was one of her golden geese. So, she loved them a lot. which did not mean that she was inclined to use one as a means of transportation, and for a very easy reason at that.\n\nAiko could make a bicycle fly. but she had no idea how to ride one. The entire thing mystified her to no end.\n\n'Should I ask Boss to teach me?' That'd be a funny story to tell her grandkids one day. if she survived to tell the tale.\n\nIn any case, Aiko managed to hail a carriage rapidly. Climbing into the soft seat, she told the driver where she wanted to go and leaned back, enjoying the view and the warmth of the sun on her face. She even started to hum a happy song quietly, feeling that her day simply could not get any better. She was still humming it when the carriage suddenly shook and came to an abrupt halt, as if hit by an earthquake.\n\nThen, an enormous yellow eye appeared outside the window, staring at Aiko with sizzling intensity.\n\nThe driver reeled back on his seat, shouting in fear and indignation:\n\n\"An an Echo?! Who let their Echo run wild, dammit?\"\n\nLetting out a sigh, Aiko opened the door and floated out of the carriage.\n\n\"Language!\"\n\nOutside, an enormous wolf sat on the ground, towering above the carriage like a small mountain of white fur. Its tail was wagging wildly, making the ground shake a little with each strike. The wolf's tongue was hanging sideways from its mouth, and it was panting happily, staring at Aiko with gleaming eyes. She glanced at the driver and frowned. \"That is not an Echo. Can't you see? That is the venerable Saint Ling. Watch your tongue in front of a child, mister!\""

    "content": "2428 Fairy Godmother\n\n\"Auntie Aiko! Auntie Aiko! Let's fly!\"\n\n\"No. Walk on your two feet.\"\n\n\"Don't wanna! Walking on two feet is stupid!\"\n\n\"What? How is it stupid?\"\n\n\"Auntie Aiko. four feet is the way to go. Don't you know?\"\n\n\"Yes, but wolfie, you are a big boy now.\"\n\n\"Ling Ling is not a big boy. I am only six years old!\"\n\n\"I mean that you are too big to walk on all fours. The street is not wide enough.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"So.\"\n\n\"So let's fly!\"\n\nAiko suppressed a smile.\n\nLittle Ling had assumed his human form, so she was holding his hand as they walked along a tranquil street. It would have been a cute scene, in normal circumstances, but the two of them made for a strange pair - mainly because she was barely taller than the little boy.\n\nAiko was very petite, while Little Ling had been abnormally large even as a toddler. Now that he was six whole years old, his height was no different from someone twice his age. It was a bit scary to imagine what the boy would look like when he grew up. The rascal would probably dwarf even his inordinately tall mom, which was a rare feat.\n\nStill, his height aside, Little Ling glanced like an adorable six-year-old now. He was a proper child, not the clumsy toddler he used to be. It was very strange to see him all grown up, forming full sentences, and talking like a little adult.\n\nAiko had not even had to remind him to summon his clothes when he turned into a human! Her chest swelled with pride.\n\n'Ah, time flies.'\n\nAnd speaking of flying.\n\nShe cleared her throat.\n\n\"We can fly when we pass the gate, alright?\"\n\nLittle Ling smiled radiantly.\n\n\"Deal!\"\n\nHe fell silent for a few seconds, and then said thoughtfully:\n\n\"But, Auntie Aiko.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Ling Ling is six years old now.\"\n\n\"Uh - huh.\"\n\n\"I turned six last week.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"My birthday was last week, too.\"\n\n\"Makes sense. And?\"\n\n\"But Auntie did not come.\"\n\n\"I am here now, aren't I?\"\n\n\"But! What about my birthday gift?\"\n\nAiko laughed.\n\n\"Am I not enough of a gift?\"\n\nLittle Ling stared at her with wide eyеs, cornered and aghast.\n\nHe frowned, thinking hard, and then smiled.\n\n\"Auntie Aiko is a gift! But. you are not a birthday gift!\"\n\nShe grinned.\n\n\"Alright, alright. Of course, I brought a gift. Who do you take me for, wolfie?\"\n\nFinally, they reached the gate of Effie's estate.\n\nAs the Steward of Bastion - and of the entire East - Effie was supposed to reside in the main keep of the great castle. However, she mentioned something about it being too stuffy and remained in her original place of residence, which was a large estate on what had once been the outskirts of the city.\n\nNow, her estate was considered to be in the very heart of it, of course, since the city had grown tremendously. In fact, the very fact that Raised by Wolves herself was residing here made the surrounding area one of the most prestigious and sought-after neighborhoods. The price of land had skyrocketed, and the huge swath of it Effie had claimed when the entire place was a desolate wasteland was suddenly exorbitantly precious.\n\nThe wasteland was long gone, naturally. Now, there were only neat streets and green trees around, with tasteful manors hidden behind tall hedges and elegant fences. The people living here were all affluent and powerful, most of them of a high Rank and coming from either the old Legacy clans or from the newly risen Transcendent families.\n\nThe gate to Effie's estate stood wide open - it had been left that way when Little Ling dashed outside in excitement after catching Aiko's scent. The gate itself was colossal enough to allow most Saints to pass through in their Transcendent forms, but Aiko still managed to close it behind them with the help of the Aspect.\n\nShe did have to catch her breath after exerting herself to accomplish that feat, though.\n\n'Ah. should have just asked Ling Ling to close it.'\n\nThat would have been the smart thing to do. but Aiko had her pride, as well! And while she was ready and willing to steal candy from children, if need be, asking a little boy for help was a bit too embarrassing.\n\nInstead, she floated Little Ling up and pulled the giggling boy behind her like a balloon while walking up the wide path.\n\nEffie's estate was truly huge - it was an entire park, really, more than spacious enough for her son to run around in his Transcendent form or for her to lie down and relax on the grass in hers. And that was not even counting the Beast Farm hidden in a dimensional Memory usually kept around her husband's neck.\n\nIt took Aiko a few minutes to reach the house. Her stiletto heels were not the best fit for the gravel path, so she ended up flying, as well - the two of them rushed through the air, brushing against the treetops, before landing near Effie's porch.\n\nThere, a tall and athletic figure was waiting for them, leaning on a wooden beam.\n\nEffie grinned.\n\n\"Well, well, well. Hey there, Tinker Bell.\"\n\nAiko glanced up and gave the vivacious huntress a dirty look.\n\n\"Hey yourself, Gargantuanne. Look, I brought your Pantagruel.\"\n\nEffie looked down and then a little more down.\n\n\"Why thank you, dear Thumbelina. You are so sweet.\"\n\nAiko scoffed.\n\n\"No need to thank me, Madam Gulliver. It's my pleasure!\"\n\nLittle Ling looked between them with a confused expression, then said hesitantly:\n\n\"Mom. that's Auntie Aiko. Why are you calling her names?\"\n\nEffie laughed, then stepped off the porch and bent down to hug Aiko.\n\n\"She had no one to blame but herself! Who told you to be so tiny and so cute, huh, Aiko?\"\n\nInstead of an answer, Aiko slammed her fist into Effie's ribs.\n\n\"You're going to wrinkle my blouse! Let go, you huge menace!\"\n\nEffie squeezed her a little tighter instead, though.\n\n\"I am not huge. I am comely, curvaceous, and shapely. Why, jealous much?\"\n\nFinally, Aiko was set free. Floating away a few steps, she straightened her blazer and gave Effie a glare.\n\n\"As if!\"\n\nLittle Ling giggled.\n\nLooking at the two women - one extremely tall, the other extremely petite - he raised a hand and waved.\n\n\"Auntie! Say bye to mom. Mom's gotta go.\"\n\nAiko landed on the ground and blinked a couple of times.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nAt that moment, Effie coughed.\n\n\"Oh. That's right. I have to run.\"\n\nAiko frowned in confusion.\n\n\"No, wait a minute. What do you mean, you have to run? I've only just got here?\"\n\nEffie backed away.\n\n\"Well, you know how it is. I have to steward the East, and all that. They need me in the Castle. and Ling's Dad is off dealing with the city fields.\"\n\n'What?'\n\nSuddenly, a terrible suspicion hit Aiko. She was so agitated by it that her feet left the ground.\n\n\"Did. did you lure me here. to be a babysitter?\"\n\nEffie was already a few steps away.\n\n\"Sorry!\"\n\nAiko was stunned.\n\nShe was scandalized.\n\n\"Hey, do you know who I am?\"\n\nTurning away, Effie grinned.\n\n\"Of course I know! You're the best! Love you, have fun!\"\n\nA second later, she was gone, leaving Aiko alone with Little Ling.\n\nAiko turned her head and looked at the boy in complete shock.\n\nLittle Ling smiled and offered her an open palm.\n\nHis voice wаs very serious.\n\n\"Let's have fun, Auntie. Also. my gift? Where is it?\"\n\nAiko took a deep breath, then forced out a pale smile.\n\n'I'll. kill her, I think.'"

    "title": "2429 Secret Party.docx",
    "content": "2429 Secret Party\n\nEffie's home was more cozy than luxurious, which was not what one would expect from the home of a woman who was ruling over half of all humans in the Dream Realm. But then again, it had been built before Godgrave, and her husband had done most of the building with his own two hands - so it would have been strange to expect palatial opulence from their residence.\n\nIn fact, the home was quite similar to the wooden farmhouse hidden inside the Black Beast Locket - Aiko had been to the Beast Farm numerous times, so she could attest to that.\n\nOf course, the wood used in the construction and to craft the furniture inside was not at all of the mundane sort.\n\nIt was in fact much sturdier than any material ever produced on Earth, gathered by Effie and her husband in the haunted woods around the greater Bastion area. Everything here was built to last.\n\nIt had to be, considering that there was a Transcendent child running around the house. Parents usually childproofed their homes, but Effie had to do the opposite - she had to make sure that her home was not entirely demolished by her child. To partial success.\n\nAiko had always been a transient person, coming and going easily, so the idea of rooting yourself in one spot seemed a little strange to her. Still, every time she visited Effie, she felt like she could almost understand the allure.\n\nEffie had built herself a family, and then built herself a house. Then, she added the former to the latter, and made it into a home. Maybe that was why she was fighting so hard.\n\nIn any case, today, Aiko and Little Ling were alone in the large home. She guided him to the dining room and made the boy sit at the table, then wandered into the adjacent kitchen. Looking around there, she called out:\n\"So, how have you been, wolfie? Have you been a good boy?\"\n\nHe swung his legs, waiting impatiently.\n\n\"I've been good, Auntie! Oh, but I was a little sad. Mommy was away for a long time this time, because other kids needed her help. She made it back before my birthday party, though! And she brought me a present from the the the Western Kadrant. That's Africa! I read about it in a book.\"\n\nAiko finally found what she had been looking for. It would be a real tragedy to stain her luxurious clothes, so she put on a white apron and exhaled in satisfaction.\n\"Read it in a book? Since when do you know how to read, rascal?\"\n\nAs she emerged from the kitchen, Little Ling gave her a pitying look.\n\"Auntie Aiko, I am six years old. Of course, I know how to read. I can read books with pictures, and even books without pictures.\"\n\nHe raised his chin proudlу, then deflated a little.\n\"Oh, but only in human language. Runic language is too difficult. So, I still need pictures when reading runes.\"\n\nAiko blinked a couple of times.\n'Six years is a little too early to know how to read, though. I think? When do children usually start reading?'\nShe had no idea. More importantly.\n\n\"Huh? Who is teaching you to read in runic language? And why?\"\nCome to think of it, maybe Little Ling did need to know runes. He was a carrier of the Spell, after all.\n\nAiko was suddenly engrossed by the question of how the little boy interacted with the Spell, to begin with. Did it show him runes, even? How would it translate the runes to people who could not read? Would it show them a series of images, instead, or simply narrate every word? Would they simply understand the meaning of the runes despite not knowing how to decipher letters? Was there a way to somehow make money out of this?\n\nLittle Ling giggled.\n\"Grandpa Julius!\"\n\nAiko snapped out of her reverie, feeling a hint of sorrow as the breathtaking ringing of illusory coins she was daydreaming about faded away.\n\"Oh? Who is that?\"\n\nThe boy smiled, still swinging his legs.\n\"My tutor. Mommy says Grandpa Julius is the best!\"\n\n'Julius, Julius.'\n\nWas he the elderly academic in charge of the entire Dream Realm Education Initiative?\n\nDamn. Effie did not hold back when it came to Little Ling's development, it seemed.\n\nShaking her head, Aiko smiled and summoned her luxurious leather handbag.\n\"Well, in any case. Auntie was very sad to miss your birthday, wolfie. Uncle Sunny was very sad, too. So, he prepared you a little gift.\"\n\nWith that, she opened the bag and started to produce one item after another. They floated into the air as if by magic, landing softly on the table. First came the ice cream, then the fluffy waffles, fresh strawberries, custard cake with six colorful candles, chocolate pudding, bottles of freshly squeezed juice, more ice cream. Soon, the entire table was brimming with delicious treats. Placing the last item down, Aiko straightened her apron and smiled.\n\"Actually, I decided to have a second, secret birthday party - just you and me. Only the bestest of boys get to have one, so here you go. Happy birthday, wolfie!\"\n\nLittle Ling's eyes were as wide as saucers. He stared at the delicious feast, as if enthralled by it, and then reached for the ice cream with a trembling hand.\n\nThen, however, he stopped and hesitated for a moment. Seeing that the boy was troubled by something, Aiko raised an eyebrow.\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nLittle Ling lingered for a few seconds, then asked in a tentative tone:\n\"Auntie Aiko, I know that this is a secret party, but can we leave a little cake for mommy? Mommy eats a lot.\"\n\nAiko's lips shook. Struggling to maintain a calm expression, she pretended to consider for a while, and then nodded.\n\"Alright. Your mommy does indeed eat a lot. So, we'll set aside a little bit of this and a little bit of that for her. Thеn, she can share with your daddy too. How does that sound?\"\n\nLittle Ling did not hear her, though. He was already busy stuffing his cheeks with treats.\n\"Shanksh, Auntie Aiho!\"\n\nShe observed the littlе boy for a few seconds, then sighed and sat down herself. Propping up her chin on a hand, Aiko glanced at Little Ling lazily and stayed silent. The boy was so engrossed by the ice cream that nothing else seemed to exist for him.\n\nIdle thoughts bounced around her head, until one particular one drew her attention. 'Are we really supposed to stay here all day? When did Effie say she would return?'\n\nIn fact, Effie had not mentioned anything about how long Aiko was supposed to watch Ling Ling at all. And what was the boy supposed to be doing the whole day? Considering that he already had a tutor, it was unlikely that Effie and his dad allowed him to stay idle all the time. She knew they hаd gently trained him from before he could walk to know how to control his Transcendent strength. He was almost around the age when mundane children went to school now, too. Of course, there was no school in existence that could handle a little Saint.\n\nEventually, Aiko's eyes gleamed.\n\"Hey, wolfie.\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment or two, then grinned.\n\"How about you and I go on an adventure? Well, let's call it an educational trip.\"\n\nLittle Ling raised his head, his face smeared in ice cream and chocolate in equal measure. His eyes widened.\n\"An educational trip?\"\n\nAiko's grin widened, too.\n\"Sure, let's call it that. Let Auntie Aiko teach you a thing or two.\""

    "content": "2430 Auntie Aiko's Lessons\n\n\"Good afternoon, Ms. Aiko... oh? And who is that little fellow by your side?\"\n\n\"This is Transcendent Ling. Wolfie, say hi.\"\n\n\"Hi, mister!\"\n\n\"T - transcendent. Ling? Saint Athena's heir?\"\n\n\"Sure. Why?\"\n\n\"B - but... why is he with you, Ms. Aiko?\"\n\n\"Well, why else? I am his favorite auntie. Right, Ling Ling?\"\n\n\"Right! Auntie Aiko is the best!\"\n\n\"So, about the contract we discussed last month. If I remember, the price you insisted on was a little on the heavy side. Something about my lack of credentials?\"\n\n\"What? No, no... ahaha, that must have been a clerical error. Those darn clerks, always making errors! Obviously, the offer you initially put forward was more than fair, Lady Aiko!\"\n\n\"It was, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Indeed! So... should we redraw the contract right now?\" That one went well.\n\n\"I hope you don't mind. This cutie is my close friend's boy. I am rarely in Bastion, so hе insisted on following me around.\"\n\n\"Auntie took me on an educational trip!\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Excuse me? Are you okay?\"\n\n\"This is... this is Saint Ling.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you know the rascal!\"\n\n\"Then... your close friend is...\"\n\n\"Effie? Ah, sorry. I think you call her Saint Athena here. Or was it War Beast? Raised by Wolves? Steward of the East? Honestly, she has so many titles these days that I get confused.\"\n\n\"Mommy is the best!\"\n\n\"S - sorry. What can I do for you, my lady? Oh, and for you, venerable Saint Ling?\"\n\n\"You see, I have heard that your club is very exclusive and only allows people of immaculate standing to become members. My standing is not too notable here in Bastion, so I would not want to impose.\"\n\n\"No, no! What are you talking about, Lady... Aiko, was it? Please. May I offer you and your young companiоn some refreshments while I fill out the paperwork? How does VIP membership sound? No, what am I talking about! VVIP membership it is.\"\n\n\"Thank you kindly. Oh, but I did not think you had VVIP members?\"\n\n\"We do now!\"\n\n\"How wonderful. What is it, wolfie?\"\n\n\"Auntie, ask mister if they have ice cream. Ling Ling thinks that he will be very refreshed if he eats ice cream.\" That one went even better.\n\n\"Welcome! How can I help you?\"\n\n\"Good day. My young friend here kept insisting on getting ice cream.\"\n\n\"Well, you certainly came to the right place. So, would you like to buy our signature ice cream?\"\n\n\"I would like to buy your ice cream shop.\"\n\n\"...Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Auntie Aiko! I want pistachio flavor!\"\n\n\"I see. That will be your ice cream shop and one cone of pistachio ice cream, please. Can I pay in cash?\" That one went wonderfully, too!\n\nSome time later, Aiko and Little Ling were sprawled on a bench in a small park, enjoying two cones of ice cream. The sun was shining high in the sky, and both of them basked in its warmth, tired and deeply satisfied.\n\nLittle Ling licked his pistachio ice cream, let out a content sigh, and glanced at Aiko.\n\n\"Auntie, can I ask you a question?\"\n\nAiko shrugged.\n\n\"Sure, go ahead.\"\n\nThe boy considered his words for a moment.\n\n\"This was the best educational trip ever, Auntie! But was it really educational? Grandpa Julius usually gives me lessons, homework, and tests. That's education!\"\n\nAiko smiled faintly.\n\n\"Was it educational? Of course, it was! Listen, wolfie... your mom and dad - and Grandpa Julius as well - can teach you many things at home. But there are some lessons that can only be learned outside. Today, you were supposed to learn one such lesson. Can you tell me what that lesson was?\"\n\nLittle Ling scrunched his face in concentration, remembering where they had been, whom they had talked to, and how those conversations had gone.\n\nEventually, he offered in a hesitant tone:\n\n\"That everyone loves mommy?\"\n\nAiko grinned.\n\n\"Exactly! The lesson you were supposed to learn today is that having friends is more important than having money.\"\n\nLittle Ling looked into the distance thoughtfully.\n\n\"Oooh...\"\n\nAiko nodded.\n\n\"Because if you have the гight friends, you can make way more money!\"\n\nThe boy gave her a dubious look. She bit into her ice cream, enjoyed its smooth texture and rich flavor, then swallowed and raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nLittle Ling stared at her for a second more, then sighed and looked away.\n\n\"Nothing. It's just that... I don't think you're really suited to be a teacher, Auntie.\"\n\nAiko looked at him in indignation.\n\n\"What? Why?\"\n\nThe boy sighed again.\n\n\"Maybe I should ask Grandpa Julius to give you lessons, too.\"\n\nAiko scoffed.\n\n\"Who is going to teach whom? Let me tell you, wolfie. I had the best tutors in NQSC when I was your age. Well, before my family went bankrupt. Money is important - you have to have money to get educated, first!\"\n\nShe shook her head and looked around.\n\nThe neighborhood they were in was close to the lakefront, so she knew it well from before the war. It was close to a ferry station and near one of the main streets, as well - foot traffic here was excellent, and the location offered easy access to several popular landmarks. More than that, one of the runic tramways was set to be built just outside the small park. That was the reason Aiko had purchased the ice cream shop on the corner. Not only was it going to bring in good income, but having a covert safe house here would be quite convenient for members of the Shadow Clan operating in Bastion.\n\nGranted, the neighborhood had become less picturesque since Aiko left the city. She had never seen graffiti here before, for example, but now several were marring the walls of the surrounding buildings.\n\nLittle Ling was staring at one such questionable art piece, as well.\n\n\"Auntie Aiko, what letters are those? Auntie Spell is not translating them.\"\n\nShe blinked a couple of times.\n\n'Wha-'\n\nWhat the hell was he talking about?\n\n\"First of all, the Nightmare Spell is not your auntie. It is ancient, so at best, it's your grandma. Grandpa? Anyway, don't put me in the same category as the Spell, please.\"\n\nShe frowned.\n\n\"Secondly, don't go around reading graffiti. Those are usually bad words! What will happen to me if you learn a bad word on my watch? Goodness gracious. Your mom will kill me.\"\n\nLittle Ling blinked a few times and looked at her with wide eyes.\n\n\"Auntie Aiko... what are bad words?\"\n\nAiko froze.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nClutching his melting ice cream, the little boy leaned forward excitedly.\n\n\"Bad words. What are they?\"\n\nShe coughed.\n\n\"What, you have never heard a bad word before?\"\n\nLittle Ling shook his head energetically.\n\n\"Nope! But! Now that I know that they exist, I really want to learn! Grandpa Julius says that learning is a noble calling! Will you teach me?\"\n\nAiko gulped, suddenly feeling cold despite the warm day.\n\n\"You... eat your ice cream before it melts, wolfie. Forget I said anything.\"\n\n'Oh, no.'\n\nEffie was definitely... definitely going to kill her."

    "content": "2431 City Gates\n\nThe last stop Aiko decided to make was on the outskirts of the city, far away from the lake.\n\nShe and Little Ling rode an open carriage pulled by an Echo, the driver sitting on the bench in a relaxed pose. The boy was looking around curiously, having spent most of his life close to the lake - the street they were following was one of the main thoroughfares of Bastion, cutting all the way frоm the shore to the city gates. There were plenty of fascinating sights.\n\nThe gates themselves were not very impressive, though - in fact, there was no gate at all, just a wide open space where the departing caravans gathered before embarking on the perilous journey across the dire reaches of the Dream Realm, and where the battered arriving caravans stopped.\n\nSome of the caravans carried settlers, some carried cargo. Out of the latter, some were loaded with necessary resources that the Domain supplied to periphery cities in the East, while some belonged to entrepreneurial merchants. Servicing the caravans was an industry in and of itself.\n\nSo, a lively bаzaar had grown around the gate, with countless stalls, plentiful inns, and shops of all kinds. In fact, the Bazaar was a little town in and of itself, with many pеople living here on a permanent basis.\n\nOn both sides of the non-existent gate, tall walls separated Bastion from the wild expanse beyond. the walls were tall, but not very impressive either. In truth, they were barely more than mounds of compressed earth - that was because the construction was still in process, and this was merely a temporary measure.\n\nBastion was a vast Domain city, and on top of that, it was situated in the Dream Realm - which might have been settled by humans, but not at all tamed. As a result, securing it was a titanic undertaking. The construction of the city wall was of paramount importance, but it was taking time.\n\nHumans were no strangers to constructing great barriers around their cities, but this was not the waking world with its sophisticated technology and expansive infrastructure. Building anything in the Dream Realm was much harder because people did not have powerful machines, automated factories, and enormous smelting plants here. Instead, though, they had Awakened, Masters, and Saints - which was why building a wall around a city as sprawling as Bastion was even possible.\n\nNo two Awakened were the same, though, so the walls of Bastion were a bit peculiar. Some of the sections had been built out of compressed earth, some out of stone, some out of wood or metal. Some were even composed of many trunks of towering trees that had fused together, while some were made of thorns and brambles.\n\nA small army of Awakened patrolled the walls day and night, and a larger army of builders was still hard at work turning them into an impregnable fortification.\n\n\"Woooow.\"\n\nLittle Ling took in the lively sight of the bazaar with wide eyes.\n\n\"So many people! And those Echoes! Wow!\"\n\nDisembarking from the carriage, Aiko offered him her hand and smiled.\n\n\"Lots of scents, yes? Don't get overwhelmed.\"\n\nThe boy sniffed the air a few times and beamed.\n\n\"Yummy! Yummy yummy yummy! Auntie Aiko, can we eat?\"\n\nShe nodded seriously.\n\n\"Of course! In a bit.\"\n\nWith that, she glanced around the bazaar herself.\n\nWhile Little Ling was busy discerning the most delicious scent, Aiko turned to the carriage driver and pointed to one of the buildings nearby.\n\n\"A new inn? Since when was it here?\"\n\n'Such a prime spot.'\n\nThe driver shook his head.\n\n\"That one is not an inn.\"\n\nAiko gave him a strange look.\n\nThe man was exceedingly handsome and held himself with gallant poise - it was quite strange to see someone so distinguished driving an Echo carriage, to say the leаst. She let out a mental sign.\n\nWell, of course the driver was handsome, gallant, and dreamy. He was Master Quentin, after all.\n\nAiko knew that if something happened, Little Ling would be able to defend himself better than she could. Nothing really compared with the strength of a Transcendent, child or not, while she was a measly Awakened. Still, she was not going to take Effie's precious son out on the town without reliable protection.\n\nSo, Quentin had been demoted to a carriage driver for a day, taking them around Bastion since morning. Of course, the man did not complain.\n\nReminding herself that he was taken, Aiko suppressed the impulse to bat her eyelashes at him and raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\nQuentin nodded.\n\n\"It's a church.\"\n\nShe frowned slightly.\n\n\"You mean one of those weird meditation halls where people definitely do not pray to Nephis?\"\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n\"No, this one is an actual church. Church of the Moon, or something like that. It's a tiny cult. These guys are mostly harmless, too. They used to be a bunch of wanderers, traveling with caravans and offering blessings for safe journeys. Things seem to be looking up for them, though, considering that they've been able to buy this building.\"\n\nAiko blinked a few times.\n\n\"Church of the Moon? As in, they worship Beast God? The dead one?\"\n\nQuentin shook his head.\n\n\"No, they just worship the moon. If you ask me, traveling and guidance is more of a Storm God thing. but I am not well-versed in inventing religions, so what do I know?\"\n\nAiko studied the modest church, which did not look any more opulent than the surrounding inns, and pursed her lips.\n\n\"Shame. I had my eyes on that location. Gods, these weirdos really do grow like mushrooms. Where are they all coming from, anyway? I have never even heard about cults being a thing before.\"\n\nQuentin nodded.\n\n\"The government used to be strict about it. Plus, it is not easy to muster religious zeal in a world where gods are dead, and the Nightmare Spell exists. But things are different now. Lady Nephis was right to share the truth of what fate awaits Earth with the people, but not everyone can bear the weight of truth. So, people are turning to all kinds of things to soothe their fear. Granted.\"\n\nHe turned and glanced at the distant silhouette of the Ivory Island drifting high in the sky above the city.\n\n\"Most are turning to Immortal Flame. Why believe in anything else if there is a literal goddess looking over you from above?\"\n\nAiko nodded.\n\n'Well, or an eccentric demigod looking up at you from the shadows.'\n\nShe gave Quentin a long look.\n\n\"Still. This Church of the Moon. Did you make a report about it?\"\n\nHe smiled faintly.\n\n\"There are too many tiny sects popping up here and there these days to make an individual report on each one. We've been compiling information to make a batch report after the solstice, though, when things calm down a little.\"\n\nAiko nodded again.\n\n\"Good. I want to know everything there is to know about these 'harmless cultists'. You know what's at stake.\"\n\nQuentin studied her for a bit, then sighed.\n\n\"Lady Aiko. You know, it would be much easier on us if we knew what it is that we are looking out for, exactly.\"\n\nShe shook her head and looked away.\n\n\"Some things are too perilous to know. And some things become more perilous the more people know about them. There is a reason why Boss is keeping everyone in the dark, so just trust his judgment.\"\n\nAiko knew more than most, but even she had not been told everything. The threat Changing Star and the Lord of Shadow seemed so wary of was apparently of a kind that should never be spoken about aloud.\n\n\"Auntie Aiko! Look! Look!\"\n\nLittle Ling pulled on her hand, pointing to the road excitedly.\n\nThere, a battered caravan was approaching the city.\n\nAiko smiled faintly."

    "title": "2432 Dream Realm Caravan.docx",
    "content": "2432 Dream Realm Caravan\n\nSeeing a caravan coming in was always impressive, which was why Aiko had taken Ling Ling to the bazaar for the last stop of their little adventure.\n\n\"Wow!\"\n\nThe boy was properly entranced.\n\nThe Dream Realm was vast, and the network of roads between the nascent human cities was in its infant state. More than that, the wilderness teemed with Nightmare Creatures and horrors of all kinds, so it took preparation and great effort to reach the destination unscathed or reach it at all.\n\nThe situation was somewhat better in the West, where the River of Tears served as a medium connecting the Citadels in its basin, but here in the East, the caravans had to be formidable forces to courageous the harrowing expanse of the Dream Realm.\n\nOut there in front of thе city, a long chain of colossal Echoes was moving slowly across the rugged terrain. Each was as tall as a building - the leading beast was especially impressive, towering above the rest, with scarlet scales covering its body and three long horns crowning its colossal head.\n\nThe Echoes were clad in heavy armor, each pulling an enormous wagon behind them. The wagons themselves were heavily armored, as well, resembling rolling fortresses. Their great wheels crushed the soil as they turned, and seasoned Awakened warriors kept watch on the battlements, bearing scars of innumerable battles.\n\nThe wagons bore many scars, too - some old, some new. Their armor was bent and battered, torn in some places, with the enchanted wood beneath splintered and charred. The Awakened warriors were covered in dust and dirt, their weariness and exhaustion palpable even from a distance.\n\nEven the Echoes seemed fatigued, the colossal chains connecting them to the wagons rattling dully. Still, it was an amazing sight to behold, especially for a child.\n\n\"Auntie Aiko! These Echoes are even bigger than me! Oh. I wonder how heavy those wagons are! Do you think I can pull one?\"\n\nAiko glanced at Little Ling with a smile.\n\n\"Wolfie. let's not talk about your potential career as a wolf of burden, alright? I doubt that your mom will be happy to learn that her precious baby is dreaming about running away with a caravan to pull wagons. In fact, she might take my head clean off my shoulders if she does. and I want to keep my head firmly attached to my body, thank you very much.\"\n\nLittle Ling giggled.\n\n\"Auntie. mommy doesn't have to know, does she?\"\n\nAiko stared at him in shock and outrage.\n\n'What, he knows how to lie now?'\n\nWho taught him? ! Which lowlife was being a bad influence on this pure, innocent boy?\n\nShe was going to bankrupt them.\n\n\"Your mom might not know, but Auntie Cassie will know. She knows everything, so be a good boy and never lie to your mother!\"\n\nAiko huffed in indigestion.\n\nLittle Ling glanced at her and grinned.\n\n\"Should I tell her about how we convinced that one uncle to sign an ex - clue - see - wity contract with you today, Auntie?\"\n\nShe cleared her throat and turned away.\n\n\"On second thought, what Effie doesn't know can't hurt her. Your mommy is a very busy person, so we shouldn't burden her with every little detail, should we?\"\n\nShe raised her hand and hastily pointed forward.\n\n\"Look! They're approaching!\"\n\nThe caravan reached the vicinity of the city. The colossal Echoes stopped, and the wagons came to a halt. The entire bazaar suddenly boiled, innumerable people rushing forward to witness the arrival - since everyone here made a living by servicing the caravans, this was the moment they had been waiting for.\n\nNo one rushed to leave the boundary of the city, though. First, the arriving caravan had to be inspected with the help of special Memories and sorcerous tools. It did not take very long, though. Eventually, the guards finished their task and let the tired travelers through. The wagons were brought to the empty space in front of the gates, the Echoes were dismissed, and the long process of unloading the cargo started.\n\nIn the chaotic mess that followed, Aiko found an imposing man in monster hide armor and waved elegantly at him.\n\nThe man was a Master and the owner of the returned caravan. He had been discussing something with a few of his subordinates, but shooed them away when Aiko approached.\n\nHis low, confident voice sounded a little surprised:\n\n\"Miss Aiko? I thought our meeting was not until tomorrow. I did not expect you to meet us personally.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"Well, I happened to be in the neighborhood. Why put off something for tomorrow when it can be done today, right?\"\n\nThe man lingered for a while, then glanced at Little Ling in confusion.\n\n\"And this is?\"\n\nAiko maintained a polite expression.\n\n\"Oh, this? This is Saint Ling. my dear friend's offspring. Wolfie, say hi to Uncle.\"\n\nLittle Ling grimaced and turned his nose away.\n\n\"I don't wanna. This mister smells funny.\"\n\nAiko's smile turned a little forced.\n\n\"Ling Ling! Don't be rude. Also, don't just go around sniffing people!\"\n\nThe little boy just shrugged unhappily.\n\nShe studied him for a few seconds, then turned to the caravan Master.\n\n\"Please forgive his manners. He is usually well - behaved. you know, when he's at home. With his mom. Saint Athena, Raised by Wolves. Steward of the East. Oh, what was I talking about? Right, the special cargo you delivered - I am ready to take it off your hands гight away. Let's say. a thousand soul shards?\"\n\nThe man studied Little Ling for a moment or two, then smiled widely.\n\n\"What a boisterous boy. Sorry, kid. I've been on the road for months. You know what they say about the smell of adventure? Well, it's more of a stench, really. You get used to it, though.\"\n\nThen, he glanced at Aiko and nodded.\n\n\"A thousand soul shards sounds about right. Shall we sign the documents?\"\n\nAiko's smile froze.\n\nShe glanced at Little Ling, then back at the caravan Master.\n\nAfter remaining silent for a few seconds, she chuckled.\n\n\"Why, naturally. Time is money, right? Ah, but before that. I wanted to show you something.\"\n\nShe raised her hand, summoning a Memory. At the same time, she moved her fingers to form a shadow sign.\n\nSome distance away, Quentin's eyes suddenly turned sharp.\n\n'Little Ling not liking his smell was already suspicious enough.'\n\nAiko maintained a relaxed expression.\n\n'but a merchant who doesn't haggle? Ring the alarm!'\n\nSomething was very, very wrong with this Master."

    "content": "2433 Swindling a Horror\n\nThe Caravan Master - whoever or whatever he was - shifted his gaze, looking at the Memory forming on Aiko's hand curiously.\n\n\"That is an unusual Memory, Miss Aiko.\"\n\nIndeed. While most Memories formed from sparks of light, some were different. The Memories crafted by the spellsmiths of Fallen Valor, for example, manifested in a whirlwind of scarlet sparks instead. There were stranger ones out there, as well, even among those Memories bestowed upon Awakened by the Spell. Those were usually quite special, albeit not always more potent than the rest. The Memories crafted by the Lord of Shadows after his supposed death, however, always appeared like a torrent of darkness.\n\nAiko smiled.\n\n\"Well, you know how the Spell is. It likes to be fancy sometimes.\"\n\nThe Caravan Master chuckled and glanced at her with the same curious smile.\n\n\"Indeed I do. We, merchants, have to know these matters by heart - people assign additional value to the strangest things, after all. A flashy Memory can cost ten times the price despite not offering any additional benefits. I prefer my Memories powerful rather than flamboyant, personally. but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't want to get my hands on a couple of the latter, and sell them for a fortune.\" He laughed.\n\nAiko's smile was a little forced by then. The Caravan Master seemed perfectly human.\n\nThat was the creepiest part, really. How flawlessly he blended with the crowd, no different from any other person she had met.\n\nBut Aiko was convinced that he was not, in fact, human. That was what made her skin crawl more than encountering the creature itself did.\n\n\"But what Memory are you so eager to show me? You wouldn't be summoning a weapon, would you, Miss Aiko?\" There was no threat in his voice, and yet, Aiko suddenly felt cold.\n\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"A weapon? Goodness gracious, surely not. What am I going to do with a weapon in these heels?\"\n\nShe wasn't lying, either.\n\nHer stilettos were indeed not what one would want to wear in a ferocious battle. Granted, Aiko could float and fly as she wished, so that wasn't an issue. Still - she was a lover, not a fighter. Well. the \"lover\" part wasn't going so well for her, to be honest, but that was beyond the point.\n\n'Who cares? I love money! Now that's true romance.'\n\nFinally, a hand mirror made of polished silver appeared in her hand. It was quite a stylish little accessоry, etched with gorgeous patterns and inlaid with finely carved pieces of obsidian. The Caravan Master studied it carefully.\n\n\"Not a weapon, after all.\"\n\nHe glanced at her and smiled.\n\n\"Still. it seemed that I've been discovered. How vexing. I thought I performed the role of this human well. I even came while the Star is gone, and the Shadow it casts is gone with her.\"\n\nAiko shivered.\n\n'Not a human, then.'\n\nHer suspicion, unfortunately, had turned out to be correct.\n\n'How did this thing pass the inspection, dammit?'\n\nWhat stood in front of her was not the Ascended merchant she had been supposed to meet. Instead. it was a vessel of the Great Terror, Skinwalker.\n\nThe forces of humanity were currently locked in a losing war against the detestable creature in the Eastern Quadrant, where it was supposed to be contained. The fact that a vessel of Skinwalker had made it all the way to Bastion, past every countermeasure put in place to prevent just that eventuality. Was concerning. Actually, it was frightening.\n\nAiko forced out a smile.\n\n\"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\nWith her other hand, she pulled Little Ling closer.\n\nThe vessel of Skinwalker studied her for a few seconds, then smiled politely.\n\n\"I am curious. How did you see through my charade?\"\n\nAiko felt an impulse to mock the Nightmare Creature, even if she was powerless in front of it.\n\nShe could have told him how Little Ling had disliked his scent, and more importantly, how he completely failed to understand what kind of people merchants were. in front of Aiko of the Shadow Clan, of all people!\n\nThe distressing creature had been steadily improving its ability to mimic human behavior, cunningly making one countermeasure invented to contain it after another meaningless - but it still failed to truly fathom what it meant to be human. It couldn't. All Skinwalker could do was imitate humans while not truly understanding what it was imitating. in a sense, it did the opposite of what the practitioners of Shadow Dance were supposed to do. Not that there were numerous of those, even with all the training.\n\nIn any case, Aiko really wanted to gloat.\n\nBut why would she explain what exactly it was that the Skinwalker had done wrong to the creepy bastard? So that it could learn from its mistakes and perform better next time?\n\n'Yeah, no. I am not giving this thing a heroic monologue. After all, I am not a hero. I am a babysitter. For today.'\n\nLittle Ling hugged Aiko, sensing that there was something wrong. Some distance away, Quentin was cautiously making his way toward them.\n\nReturning the Skinwalker's smile, she glanced at her hand mirror.\n\n\"Let me finish explaining about this Memory first. I summoned it for a reason, you know?\"\n\nShe turned the mirror this way and that, casting bright reflections on the cobblestones.\n\n\"This here is a prototype of a Memory my boss has been developing in his free time. Communication is a serious problem in the Dream Realm, actually. Sure, the Immortal Flame is already working on a solution - a Dreamscape for the Dream Realm, or some such. Making it safe from all the horrors of this world is proving to be a problem in and of itself, though. Hence, we came up with our own solution. Ah, if only there was a way to mass-produce them! But I am getting off topic.\"\n\nThe vessel of the Skinwalker tilted its head.\n\n\"Communication? Are you hoping to commune with me, Awakened? Unity. community. yes.\"\n\nAiko coughed.\n\n\"Thanks. but you are not my type, sorry. Sadly, it's not like I can do anything against you, can I? I mean, I am a mere Awakened, and you are a Great Terror. What am I supposed to do?\"\n\nOh, but I do feel the need to inform you of something.\n\nShe pointed to Little Ling, who was clinging to her.\n\n\"This here is my dear friend's child. And my friend is a real she-wolf when it comes to protecting her boy. Coincidentally, today, we learned that everyone in this city loves his mom very much. Do you know why? Because she is Saint Athena, Raised byWolves, Steward of the East. the War Beast. You should know her well, considering how numerous of your vessels she has destroyed.\"\n\nAiko drew Little Ling closer and covered his eyes with her hand.\n\nThen, she smiled radiantly.\n\n\"Right, returning to the Memory. It has a really awful name, so I'll spare you the pain of hearing it. I mean. I am perfectly capable of coming up with a awful name of my own! Today, let's call it.\"\n\nAiko paused for a moment and then said in a solemn tone:\n\n\".Call Mommy.\"\n\nAnd just as she did, something thundered in the sky above them."

    "title": "2434 The Terrible Price of Saving the World.docx",
    "content": "2434 The Terrible Price of Saving the World\n\nAiko had not been bluffing when she said that she had no use for a weapon. She was neither a warrior nor had any ambition of becoming one, but that did not mean that she was harmless.\n\nAfter all, she was also a former member of the Dreamer Army. She had survived the Forgotten Shore, and it was not by accident.\n'What, did you think that running a gambling den in the damn Bright Castle was a laidback occupation?'\n\nIt certainly hadn't.\n\nThe Memory Aiko had summoned was a communication mirror the members of the Shadow Clan used when on missions. It allowed them to talk to each other remotely, or listen in on conversations if the mirror was hidden in some dark place in advance. Not that there weren't better ways of eavesdropping on people.\n\nOf course, Aiko did not really need the mirror to get in touch with Effie and inform her of the dire situation they were in - Cassie would already know, which meant that Effie had already been informed. It was a little creepy, to know that Cassie could be watching her at any given moment - but in rare cases like this one, it was also comforting.\n\nIf anything, Aiko could feel honored that she was a high-priority mark among many people the blind seer was using as hеr eyes. In any case, Aiko needed the silver mirror for a different reason. Apart from allowing those who possessed them to communicate, the mirrors were also able to reflect what was in front of them over a distance. The other person just needed to have a matching Memory, which Effie did.\n\nAiko's boss had woven that particular enchantment in a moment of petty vindictiveness, mumbling something about \"stealing that bastard's tricks\" in an unhinged tone. She had an inkling of who the aforementioned bastard was, and sometimes wondered what the poor man had done to get on her boss's naughty list. It had to be something major, considering that dropping a Cursed Demon on his head did not seem to have satisfied Sunny.\n\nWhat mattered at the moment, though, was that Aiko could use the mirror to reflect her surroundings to Effie. In other words, what she wanted to relay was not a warning that they were in trouble. It was targeting data.\n\nCountless kilometers away, at the top of the great castle, Raised by Wolves had turned north and summoned her spear. Then, she took careful aim, and tossed it into the sky with a low roar.\n\nA hurricane rose, ripping the flags hoisted above the keep to shreds and making people cower. While Aiko was talking to the vessel of the Skinwalker, the spear was ripping up the sky. It crossed the distance a mundane human would have needed days to cross on foot in less than a minute. By the time it arrived, Aiko had already covered Little Ling's eyes with a hand.\n\nIt was not out of fear of the Skinwalker. Rather, it was because a little boy had no business seeing what would happen next.\n\nAs something thundered above them, the vessel of the Great Terror glanced up. That was the last thing it ever did.\n\nWhen the spear fell from the sky, striking the former Caravan Master with flawless precision, it did not simply pierce his body. Instead, his body was simply pulverized, turning into a cloud of fine crimson haze.\n\nThe spear pierced the cobblestones next, causing a small earthquake to rattle the bazaar and sending a deep fracture running fгom the point where its tip struck the ground to the great wagons of the battered caravan. One of them tilted when its armored wheel exploded into a storm of splinters, and then toppled with a deafening groan. The walls of the little church Quentin had mentioned cracked.\n\nFar away, above the lake, rapid figures were already leaping from the emerald meadows of the Ivory Island - those were the Fire Keepers, rushing to the city gates. Of course, Effie was probably going to arrive much sooner.\n\nThere was no telling if this vessel of the Skinwalker was the only one that had avoided detection, after all. Any member of the caravan could be a disguised Nightmare Creature.\n\nNo. Actually, the Skinwalker had accidentally revealed its ability to dodge the sorcery that had been keeping it out of human Citadels so far, which meant that anyone in Bastion could be a vessel. Anyone in any of the human cities in the Dream Realm could, in fact.\n\nSo, every human city was going to undergo a period of instability. Martial law would have to be enforced until a new form of sorcery was developed. Then, the cities had to be swept, and any vessel discovered as a result would have to be eliminated.\n\nAll because Aiko had decided to take Ling Ling on a little adventure.\n\nAnd although she did not know it yet, in the coming weeks, several hidden Skinwalker infestations would indeed be discovered in remote Citadels of the eastern reaches of the Dream Realm. Luckily, they would be eradicated before the malignant Terror could really grow, thus preventing a terrible calamity. Aiko might not have stumbled into saving the world, but what she had done was not that far off from such a feat.\n\n'Damn it. I just wanted to have fun on my day off.'\n\nShe glanced down in dejection. Then, her eyes widened in horror.\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\nHer breathtaking shoes! Some of the pulverized Skinwalker vessel had splattered on them!\n\nThey were ruined.\n\n\"Damnation!\"\n\nIt was a terrible loss.\n\nStill unable to see anything because his eyes were covered, Little Ling stirred:\n\n\"Huh? What's a damnation, Auntie?\"\n\nShe bit her lip, then said in a teary tone:\n\n\"What? N - nothing! Forget you heard anything!\"\n\nLittle Ling grew quiet for a moment, then shifted, trying to get out of her embrace.\n\n\"Is damnation one of those bad words? It is, isn't it?\"\n\nAiko paled.\n\n\"I said forget it, wolfie! You didn't hear anything!\"\n\nHe dropped his shoulder.\n\n\"Alright, Auntie. I already forgot it.\"\n\nAs she pulled him away toward the carriage and gave Quentin a poignant look, Little Ling sighed and added:\n\n\"I really can't remember. Damnation! My memory has gone bad.\""

    "content": "2435 Full Moon\n\nRemembering something he already knew was a peculiar experience, but Sunny was more rattled by learning all over again what Aiko had done at the gates of Bastion.\n\nHe gritted his teeth.\n\n'Aiko. taught Little Ling a curse word?!'\n\nWhat was she thinking about?\n\nGranted, she had also uncovered a dire truth about the Skinwalker, plunged the entire Human Domain into the jaws of martial law for a couple of weeks, and prevented multiple cities from either sustaining awful losses or falling entirely. But that was beside the point!\n\n'He's only six, for Spell's sake! What kind of vulgar good - for - nothings is she hanging around with, to use strong language in front of a child?!'\n\nHe seethed for a few seconds, then took a deep breath and shook his head.\n\n'No, it doesn't matter. I'll deal with Aiko later - there are more urgent matters I must attend to at the moment.'\n\nGrimacing, Sunny nodded with determination and continued on his way.\n\nHe only took a few steps, though, when another memory came to the surface of his mind.\n\nSunny froze.\n\n\"Nephis did wh. actually, never mind. That is exactly what Nephis would do. Why am I even surprised?\"\n\nLetting out a hollow chuckle, Sunny glanced up and then resumed walking.\n\n\"So, she went fishing in the lake without me, huh? How heartless.\"\n\n***\n\nSeveral weeks earlier, Nephis was sitting at the edge of the Ivory Island, watching a sea of stars shimmer in the dark sky above Bastion. Tonight, just like the previous night, parts of the city were illuminated by the glow of electric street lights.\n\nShe was glad to see her people taking another step toward prosperity here in the Dream Realm. But because of it, the stars seemed dimmer than they had been before. That filled her with a faint sense of regret.\n\nThe stars might have become more distant, but the pale disc of the full moon slowly traveling across the surface of the tranquil lake looked closer than it had ever been before.\n\nTonight was the third and last night when the full moon would rise above Bastion this month. For these three nights, sailing on the lake was forbidden, and people were kept away from its shore.\n\nThat was because when the full moon rose, the boundary between reality and illusion grew thin here in Bastion, and the horror imprisoned in the ruins of the true castle strained to exert its dreadful influence from beyond the reflections. So, Nephis had to stay in the city during the full moon to guard it. Strangely enough, for her, these three dangerous nights were usually a time of rest and recuperation. She spent most of her time on the battlefield, leading the forces of humanity against the tide of nightmares threatening to swallow them all.\n\nDespite the hidden presence of a Cursed Demon, the sight of a full moon promised peace and serenity. Granted. she wasn't used to spending these moonlit nights alone.\n\nSunny was usually with her, either by her side or hiding in her shadow. Nephis had grown used to his presence without even knowing it - now that he was gone, his absence felt strangely unnatural.\n\nShe was surprised to find herself missing him, even if he had only been gone for a day.\n\n'Who would have thought I'd find myself feeling these emotions one day?'\n\nIt was peculiar, indeed. Not at all like her.\n\nBut it wasn't an unwelcome feeling. In fact, the sweet pain of missing someone made her feel hopeful. It made her believe that there was some life left, still, in her scorched and arid heart. So, she tried to enjoy the unfamiliar sense of faint melancholy.\n\nSunny had been forced to leave because of unforeseen - albeit not entirely unexpected - complications in Ravenheart. The incarnation he had sent there, as well as Kai, was now missing. More than that, a Cursed Tyrant and two Beasts had escaped a prison made for them by the Demon of Dread. only to end up in another seconds later, thanks to Seishan's quick thinking.\n\nNobody knew what would escape the eerie jade board next, though, so the Sovereigns had to make their way to the Jade Palace. Sunny had gone first, taking Cassie with him. Nephis herself was going to join them once the full moon was over.\n\n'Tomorrow.'\n\nTomorrow, she would see him again.\n\nLooking at the reflection of the moon shining on the surface of the lake, Nephis wondered if she would feel something then.\n\nWould she be happy? Or simply pleased?\n\nWould she feel nothing at all?\n\nWould the peculiar sorrow in her heart go away?\n\nAt that moment, the waters below rippled. The pale disc suddenly seemed distorted and eerie, gazing at her from below like a round eye plaguеd by a white cataract.\n\nThe lake stirred, and a series of waves rolled outward, climbing higher and higher up the shore.\n\nNephis tilted her head, watching it all transpire somberly.\n\n'So, it chose tonight to show its hand.'\n\nWhat an unfortunate coincidence it was. So unfortunate, in fact, that Nephis was inclined to believe that it was no coincidence at all. Had the Cursed Demon waited until only one of the Sovereigns was left in the city to try and escape?\n\nIn any case, the timing could not have been worse.\n\nHumanity was drowning in calamities, surrounded by peril and enemies on all sides.\n\nIn the waking world, more and more Gates were opening each month, and the population centers were barely holding on against the flood of Nightmare Creatures.\n\nThe Eastern Quadrant was balancing on the verge of an utter disaster. The war against the Skinwalker was not going well - the infection was spreading, and humans had to retreat further and further, abandoning their land, settlements, and entire cities.\n\nIn the Dream Realm, the hunt for new Citadels was proving to be less fruitful than she had hoped. Legions of Awakened were clearing the interior of the two vast enclaves from abominations while simultaneously exploring the far reaches to the east, the frozen hells to the west, and the dreadful waters of the misty ocean to the south. while in the north, a legion of shadows was doing the same in the scorched tangle of a burned forest.\n\nMordret's location was still unknown. Asterion still remained a worrisome mystery.\n\nAnd now, this.\n\nAll of this was pressing down on Nephis, pushing her to the ground. The weight of the entire world. two worlds, even. was resting on her shoulders, making her struggle to keep herself from falling to her knees.\n\nAnd then there were the quiet whispers of the many souls burning like stars in the vast expanse of her Domain. Their longing washed over her day and night, its pressure even more overwhelming. unbearable, at times.\n\nNephis pursed her lips.\n\nSunny was not by her side. Neither was Cassie. Kai was missing, and Effie had gone to the Western Quadrant to deal with the Category Four Gate crisis there.\n\nThere was no one Nephis could trust to have her back in a battle against a Cursed Demon here in Bastion. not tonight, at least.\n\nSo.\n\nShe would have to face it alone. She would have to carry the weight and keep walking forward, one arduous step at a time.\n\nLetting out a quiet sigh, Nephis slowly stood up and glanced at the dark lake with white flames dancing in her eyes.\n\nTwo breathtaking white wings manifested behind her, chasing away the darkness of the night.\n\n\".It is just a Cursed Demon.\"\n\nWhat was there to worry about?\n\nAn aloof, distant smile twisted her lips.\n\nSummoning the Blessing, she took a step forward and plunged into the darkness.'"

    "content": "2436 Lost Heaven\n\nA bright star ignited in the dark sky above Bastion. The people - those of them who were still on the streets, busy with fruitful endeavors or simply being festive after a hard day of work - glanced up in surprise, their eyes igniting with wonder.\n\nThe star fell from the sky, growing bigger and brighter. Soon enough, it was like a flaming white meteor plummeting from the lightless heavens to the ground. Its light illuminated the night, chasing the darkness away and making the full moon shining high above seem pale in comparison. The silver radiance of the moon could not compete with the incinerating white glow of the falling star. The night could not compete with it, either.\n\nFor a moment, it was as if the sun had risen above Bastion in the middle of the night, bringing with itself the stark beauty of daylight. Then, before people had the time to get scared, the flaming white meteor strike the surface of the lake.\n\nThere was a blinding flash, and a gigantic fountain of boiling water rose into the air, evaporating into a vast cloud as it did. The entire lake shone for a moment, as if illuminated from within, and then grew dark once more. Just like that, the falling star disappeared without a trace.\n\nThe waters of the lake surged and rippled, its surface growing restless - the perfect disc of the full moon reflected on its surface was shattered and erased, replaced by scattered fragments of silver light.\n\nOn the other side of the reflection, Nephis shot out from the dark abyss of the lake and soared into the eerie sky of the True Bastion, her radiant wings unfolding to shine blindingly in the pale radiance of the shattered moon. She rose high above the vast ruins of the great castle, looking down as white flames danced in her eyes, suffused her skin, and licked her hair. Her fiery gaze felt cold and ruthless. There was no mercy in that gaze, no hesitation, no doubt, no hope of salvation. Just a firm and inescapable promise of being burned to ash by the boundless tide of purifying flames. She regarded the ruins of True Bastion dispassionately.\n\nThe broken castle had been reduced to rubble by the battle between Morgan and Mordret. The lake, which had run dry as a result of their drawn - out confrontation, was full of water once again, shimmering eerily in the silver light of the shattered moon. Deep cracks ran through the mountain on which the ruins of the castle lay, full of stagnant water and overgrown with scarlet moss. There was a creature waiting for her in the heart of the ruins. A shapeless mountain of gray flesh towered above the rubble, covered by moss and brimming with a hundred revolting limbs that rose from it like a harrowing forest. A frightening, eerie presence emanated from the grotesque creatures, making the light of the moon seem reluctant to touch it. As a result, the creature was surrounded by a shroud of darkness. The winds avoided it, as well, so nothing disturbed the dead silence enveloping the ruins. It was as if the world itself was trying to escape it, revolted and frightened by the ancient fiend.\n\nAs Nephis looked, innumerable grotesque eyes suddenly revealed themselves on the grey mass of the Cursed Demon, opening to look back at her with a dreadful, frighteningly alien lack of emotion. She held its gaze for a few long seconds, then folded her wings and dove to the ground.\n\nLanding on the edge of the water, some distance away from the Nightmare Creature, Nephis took a deep breath and then headed in its direction with steady steps. Something peculiar happened then, though.\n\nThere was a rustle, as if the ruins themselves let out a long sigh, and then, a distant voice resounded from the depths of the crumbling castle.\n\n\"I had a dream.\"\n\nThe voice spoke in a long-forgotten language, sounding eerily human despite its low and otherworldly timbre. Nephis continued to walk, her expression never changing. The voice spoke again, full of indescribable, faint emotion:\n\n\"I dreamt of being whole again.\"\n\nThe innumerable appalling eyеs moved faintly, peering into her soul.\n\n\"I dreamt of the sun being kind again.\"\n\nAn eerie note found its way into the distant voice, making the world shiver. \"I dreamt of having wings again.\"\nThe harrowing forest of skeletal limbs stirred, blackened and charred.\n\n\"You are not the one who forced that hateful dream upon me. You are not the one who stole it from me, either. Are you?\"\n\nNephis continued to walk, offering no answer.\n\n\"And yet, I cannot forgive you. Those wings of yours, so beautiful.\"\n\nThe appalling eyes of the Cursed Demon grew darker, and its voice grew cold and insidious, full of malice so vast that it made Nephis halt for a moment.\n\n\"Blood of the Sun. Have you come to burn me?\"\n\nThe mountain of grey flesh moved, rippling as pieces of ancient stone turned to dust under its enormous weight. A hollow, mad, frightening laughter resounded above the ruins.\n\n\"Shall I extinguish you, then? Or shall I curse you? Shall I tell you how the Sun was destroyed, how our heavens burned, how the land of the Moon was swallowed by ash, how we all fell, one after another? Shall I help you become everlasting, ever-changing?\"\n\nThe voice whispered then, growing feeble and faint:\n\n\"Like me.\"\n\nWalking forward with a sword in her hand, Nephis answered evenly:\n\n\"I am not interested in talking to you, Nightmare Creature. Why waste our breaths?\"\n\nThe blade of the Blessing shone with a blinding light, turning white-hot and luminous.\n\n\"All I am interested in is ending you. So, prepare to die.\"\n\nRaising her sword, Nephis pointed it at the Cursed Demon. She was a Supreme Titan whose Domain encompassed billions of souls. This creature was an old, broken, fallen god. What right did it have to curse her?\n\nA bitter smile twisted her lips.\n\n\"Yes, I have come to burn you. I've come to destroy you. Unlike mine, your pain will be rapid. Be thankful.\""

    "title": "2437 Abjuration.docx",
    "content": "2437 Abjuration\n\nNephis had grown vastly more powerful after attaining Supremacy. However, there was nuance to that newfound power - not all of it came easily, and not all of it could be used freely in any situation.\n\nTake her Supreme Aspect Ability, for example. Sunny had gained the Ability to summon the shades that rested within him into existence, thus becoming a walking army, an army of indestructible shadows that grew with each living being he slayed, no less, which made him a truly frightening existence.\n\nNephis had gained an immensely powerful Ability, as well. However, her Supreme Ability did nothing to strengthen Nephis herself - instead, it strengthened the subjects of her Domain, allowing her to heal and strengthen them with her flames from a distance.\n\nWhich was why it was truly unfortunate that she had to face the Cursed Demon alone. Not that there were numerous people out there who could have assisted her in а battle against a Cursed Nightmare Creature.\n\nBut, naturally, she was never alone - not really. Her Domain encompassed all of humanity, after all.\n\nNot every mundane human was a part of it, but most were. Among the Awakened, meanwhile, only those of the Shadow Clan or those exiled to the penitentiary Citadel in Godgrave did not belong to her Domain - the rest of them were tied to Nephis, either by their own longing or by being anchored to the Gateways her Transcendent vassals controlled.\n\nOr possibly it was her who was tied to them.\n\nShe could feel them all, always. The flames of their yearning were like innumerable stars shining in an abyss of boundless darkness, all connected to her soul by strings of starlight. Some stars were distant and cold, so small that as to almost be non-existent - the others were like enormous bonfires, burning so brightly that their radiance was blinding, and their passion filled the abyss with warmth.\n\nThere were numerous stars in her Domain for Nephis to fathom them all individually, but drowning in their collective enormity was all too easy. Sometimes, she struggled to remember where her own identity ended and their vastness started. In those seconds, the same things that had helped her sustain her humanity helped her maintain her sense of self.\n\nHer True Name. The precious bonds she had forged with other people. The affection she held in her heart.\n\nAnd most importantly, her own ardent desire. Her own longing.\n\nHer goal.\n\nIt was peculiar, really - before, Nephis had been wary of losing her humanity. But now, she was wary of experiencing too much of humanity, all of it, possibly. Of dissolving into the immensity of her Domain completely, becoming an elemental force as opposed to a person.\n\nPossibly that was how the gods had felt. Possibly that was what being a god meant.\n\nA true Apotheosis.\n\nIf so, Nephis wanted nothing to do with it.\n\nAn element was mighty like a force of nature, but it did not have direction. It did not have conviction. It did not have will.\n\nIt did not have what it took to achieve what she desired.\n\nWalking toward the Cursed Demon, she infused her will with her desire, forging an unbreakable armor out of it.\n\n'I am not alone. This creature, though, this creature is alone, and it will die alone, cut down by my sword and burned by my flame.'\n\nEvery day, new stars ignited in the starlit vastness of her Domain.\n\nAnd every day, some of them were extinguished forever.\n\nNephis felt the loss of these stars faintly. There were numerous of them to mourn the loss of each individual flame, but she was always aware of how numerous fates were being broken and ground into dust by the ruthless world of the Nightmare Spell.\n\nHow numerous hopes and dreams were doomed to stay forever unfulfilled.\n\nShe suffered the pain of their passing personally.\n\nAs the Cursed Demon stirred and surged forward, its long limbs pulling the monstrous mountain of grey flesh across the rubble with breathtaking speed, Nephis took that pain and infused it into her Will, forging an uncompromising sword out of it.\n\nShe felt the Cursed Demon's own Will reshaping the world around them. Trying to reshape Nephis herself, as well.\n\nBy then, she already knew what this fallen god was, and what power it wielded.\n\nThere were clues for her to piece together, already. The Cursed Demon came from the Hollows of Godgrave, where it had hidden from the destructive sun for thousands of years. There were hints in what the creature had told her, too - its memories of a gentle sun, of having wings, it scorched, skeletal limbs.\n\nBut Nephis did not have to guess what her adversary was.\n\nBecause one of the brightest stars in her Domain was Cassie, and while the two of them were far apart, her friend was still with her, seeing things that no other human could.\n\nThe Cursed Demon could be called Abjuration.\n\nIt wielded the power of rejection, renouncement, and negation.\n\nAnything it denied had no choice but to cease, and everything it refused was doomed to be erased from existence.\n\nIts malignant Will was frightening, vast as an ocean, and oppressively firm in its insidious malevоlence.\n\nNo wonder Mordret had fled when faced with this distressing creature. If anything, it was a miracle that Sunny's Shadow had managed to lull Abjuration to sleep.\n\nAs the mass of grey flesh and charred limbs rushed at her, Nephis channeled her flames into the Blessing. The former shadowbound sword focused them into an destructive ray of pure white light, and that light tore the distance between her and the huge Nightmare Creature in an instant, threatening to cut the grotesque mountain of flesh in half.\n\nHowever, instead, it was simply extinguished, negated by the fallen god's profane authority.\n\nNephis frowned.\n\nHer attack had not been resisted, and neither had it been deflected. Instead, it was simply denied, canceled before ever getting a chance to do damage, as if the very concept of being hurt by her flames had been proclaimed a falsehood by the sinister fiend.\n\nAnd since the Cursed Demon had proclaimed so, it became the truth.\n\nHer hand faltered for a split second.\n\n'How am I supposed to kill a deity who denies my ability to kill it?'\n\nThe Cursed Demon was a god, a fallen, corrupted god.\n\nAnd that god did not believe in Nephis.\n\nLuckily, she believed in herself."

    "title": "2438 Concept of Humanity.docx",
    "content": "2438 Concept of Humanity\n\nThe blinding ray of pure white light struck the towering Nightmare Creature and was extinguished, denied the power to harm it, rather, vanishing without leaving a trace on the grey flesh of the Cursed Demon.\n\nTime and space themselves bent, allowing its enormous mass to draw near Nephis far more rapidly than it should have been able to. Her wings raised a hurricane, sending her flying back, out of the way of innumerable skeletal limbs that stretched forward, aiming to grab her into a deadly grip.\n\nThe world that had let the Cursed Demon pass so rapidly resisted her movement, sapping her momentum and slowing her down. If not for the armor of the Will Nephis had forged for herself, she might not have been able to move at all.\n\nAs it was, she barely avoided the harrowing forest of charred hands, slipping away between the Cursed Demon's fingers.\n\nFlying backward, she gritted her teeth.\n\nThe Nightmare Creature had a hundred hands, but Nephis only had one sword.\n\nAnd even that sword had proven ineffective against the authority of the fallen god.\n\nThe authority it possessed was too absolute in its ability to deny her. The ancient horror wielded it both as a shield and as a weapon, both as the lure and as the trap, as well, preventing the adversary from harming it while simultaneously refusing their ability to escape.\n\nNephis frowned.\n\nNo. her adversary was not simply wielding the authority of abjuration. It personified abjuration - the very concept of foreswearing something, thus negating its power and its very existence.\n\nThat was what Will could accomplish when elevated to the very edge of being absolute.\n\nHow would one fight against an absolute Will?\n\nAlthough Nephis did not know it yet, the technique Sunny would use in Ariel's Game was to channel and personify a concept that directly opposed the power of his adversary.\n\nHowever, the two of them were entirely different people, and what Sunny could achieve was not what Nephis could or should be striving to emulate. She had her own path to forge.\n\nJust then, the Cursed Demon's innumerable eyes locked on Neph's fleeting figure, their unfathomablе depths gleaming with a distressing notion.\n\nAnd a moment later, she felt her very existence beginning to grow faint.\n\nBecause Abjuration was done playing with its food. Instead of resisting her attacks, the fiend simply chose to deny Nephis herself - to reject her existence, forcing the world into erasing her completely.\n\n'How do I resist a deity's Will?'\n\nIt was a complicated question - a question that only a handful of people had been forced to ask themselves ever since the Nightmare Spell descended upon the world.\n\nTo Nephis, though, the answer was easy. She simply had to break it with her own. She simply had to crush it.\n\nIf the Nightmare Creature refused to burn, she had to burn it with more powerful flames.\n\nIf it refused to be cut, she had to slash it with a sharper blade.\n\nIf it refused to die. She simply had to convince death to take it.\n\n\"Hey, Nightmare Creature.\"\n\nNephis landed on the rubble and slid back, pushed almost to the edge of the water.\n\nHer eyes flared with distressing white radiance.\n\n\"Do you think you can snuff me out that easily?\"\n\nHer presence, which had grown faint, suddenly seemed clear, vast, and unfathomable.\n\nAbjuration might have been able to negate the existence of a Saint, of a weaker Sovereign, possibly. But Nephis ruled over and inspired all of humanity. To deny her existence, the creature would have had to erase all of mankind from existence first. To extinguish all of the innumerable stars that illuminated the vast heaven of her soul in an instant.\n\nShe was Changing Star. the Star of Ruin. The goddess of humanity.\n\nNephis did not like these words and had even taken measures to dissuade people from calling her by that title, as well as from worshipping her as a deity. But while she had not undergone Apotheosis yet, to some degree, there was truth to what some were saying.\n\nFor all intents of purposes, she had become the personification of humanity. Her sword was the sword of all humans, and carried the weight of all their hopes and dreams.\n\nOf all their longing.\n\nHer flames were fueled by their desire.\n\n\"How dare you deny me?\"\n\nSnarling, Nephis dashed forward.\n\nThe Blessing was strengthened by all of her Soul Flame, strengthened more than even her body and soul were due to its [Flame Conduit] trait. At the same time, its capacity to overwhelm the Will of Nightmare Creatures was further enhanced by the [Purifying Light] trait - the special quality of the shadowbound sword that made it especially lethal to those tainted by the Corruption.\n\nBut, more importantly, it had become the vessel of her Will.\n\nAnd her Will was fueled by her desire to slay the Cursed Demon.\n\nDesire was the root of all virtues, no less, as well as of all sin. There was hardly a more potent source of willpower than passionate yearning.\n\n'Burn!'\n\nGathering all of her Will into the tip of the blade, Nephis moved it in a downward slash - the same downward slash she had practiced myriads of times, until every minuscule detail of performing it flawlessly was absorbed into her very bones.\n\nAnd answering to her Will.\n\nThe world burned.\n\nIt burned brightly, the stone rubble melting and the dark lake boiling.\n\nBut that was only the beginning. Because in the next moment, Nephis channeled her Will into speaking the Words, as well.\n\nA frightening Verse of linked True Names escaped from her lips, summoning fire and destruction upon the world. The intense white flames surged and roared, consuming the very fabric of existence.\n\nBut Nephis was still not done.\n\nReleasing the confines of her mortal shell, she unleashed her true Transcendent form.\n\nA mass of white flame rose from the ground, easily as tall as the grotesque mountain of gray flash. The flame moved as if it possessed a life of its own, surging forward to meet the Cursed Demon.\n\nAs it did, the mass of flames assumed the form of a radiant winged figure wielding a radiant blade.\n\nThe giant blade woven out of pure white light fell, aiming to sever a dozen of the Abomination's severed limbs.\n\nThe radiance of it all was so blinding that it seemed as if dawn had shone upon the shattered darkness of True Bastion.\n\nAnd, illuminated by that light, the Cursed Demon cowered, terrified by the memories of the ruthless destructive sky.\n\nOf course, naturally, it only faltered for a brief moment."

    "content": "2439 Heaven and Hell\n\nThe world was ablaze.\n\nThe darkness of the night was vanquished, chased away by an immaculate white abyss of incandescent light. The stone rubble burned… the waters of the vast lake burned, too. Fine particles of superheated dust permeated the air, turning the crumbling ruins into an inescapable furnace.\n\nThe air itself burned; the sky was suffused with immolating light, turning everything below its merciless expanse into cinders and ash.\n\nThe boundless ocean of flames roared, its roars fusing and melting together to speak a litany of words…\n\nDestruction. Ruination. Annihilation.\n\nAt the same time, the world was frigid and frozen, devoid of all warmth.\n\nThe great lake was covered in ice, frozen solid. Rime and hoarfrost covered the ruins, painting eerie patterns on the stone rubble. The stones themselves had become weak and brittle, ready to break from the smallest touch. Tiny crystals of ice drifted slowly in the frigid air, shining in the pale radiance of the shattered moon.\n\nA deep, dead silence enveloped the ruins of the colossal castle… it was a place completely devoid of warmth and life, a place where the very idea of life was strange and abhorrent.\n\n…The world had been torn in two by the clash between a Supreme Titan and a Cursed Demon, its jagged halves fighting for dominance.\n\nNephis had infused her indomitable Will into her flames, setting the world on fire. The radiant hell she had unleashed was so terrible that the fabric of reality itself was ignited, and everything around her burned — еven the things that had never been meant to burn.\n\nAt the same time, Abjuration rejected the flame. The hideous abomination refused to be burned, and in doing so, it denied the concept of heat itself, turning the world into a frozen inferno.\n\nTwo opposite worlds had been born from the devastating clash of their Wills, both existing side by side as possibilities — neither realized nor entirely abolished, and therefore suspended in a state оf undetermined rivalry.\n\nAs Nephis and Abjuration fought, their Wills straining against each other, one world or the other took shape for a brief moment or two, becoming reality. Then, the Cursed Demon would be scorched and burned — a heartbeat later, the flames devouring its hideous body would be extinguished, and Nephis would suddenly find herself being strangled by unbearable cold. 'This… vile… thing…'\n\nShe reeled under the pressure of fighting the fallen deity's unfathomable Will and authority… of its insidious mastery over the concept of refusal that threatened to deny her very existence, let alone her ability to do the Cursed Demon harm.\n\nAt the same time, she had to fight the abomination itself.\n\nThe dreadful forest of skeletal limbs wreaked havoc across the ruins, exerting such furious might that countless tones of stone rubble were turning into fine dust every moment.\n\nNephis had severed dozens of Abjuration's arms already — the blade woven from light sliced the Cursed One's flesh and bones easily, setting the bleeding stumps aflame. But the hideous abomination was too powerful and too vast, its ability to twist the absolute laws in its favor too tyrannical. So, she had not escaped from their furious clash unscathed, either.\n\nEvery time Nephis managed to land a strike, Abjuration's hands would tear at her fiery form. The long fingers of the abomination blackened, and its claws cracked the moment it touched the white flames… but every time, some warmth was sapped from Nephis, making her flame a little more feeble, a little less scathing.\n\nWith each blow she received, her claim to existence became a little fainter.\n\nAnd there was something much more terrifying happening, as well…\n\nThere were billions of little flames connected to Neph's soul, tied to it by the bonds of longing. They were like tethers that anchored her to the world and reinforced her existence… they were the subjects of her Domain.\n\nWith each blow she received, those flames seemed to grow a little fainter, as well.\n\nIt was when Nephis realized the fact that she felt something she had not felt in a long, long time…\n\nShe felt fear.\n\nAt the start of her battle against Abjuration, she had regarded it with derision, assured that the terrifying fiend would not be able to negate her existence — because it would have tо negate the existence of all of humanity with her, as well.\n\nBut now…\n\nThe Cursed Demon was doing just that.\n\nBillions of people were connected to Nephis and her Domain of Longing, bestowing her with great power and a nearly inexhaustible ocean of spirit essence. But that connection was a blade that cut both ways.\n\nBecause Nephis was connected to humanity, an especially insidious enemy could reach across the dark void through her, and follow the rays of beautiful starlight to their source. To humans who had been inspired by her, and whom she was supposed to protect.\n\nAbjuration… was one such enemy.\n\nThis Cursed Demon was old, powerful, and terrifying. It had soared in the boundless heaven as one of the Spirits of Sun God's realm before falling into the vile depths of Corruption. It had survived the Doom War, outlived the Lord of Light, and spent thousands of years hiding from the merciless radiance of the orphaned sky in the sweltering darkness of Godgrave.\n\nAnd now, it was here, in the hidden remains of True Bastion. Liberated from under the incandescent abyss that had imprisoned it, and free to spread its appalling influence as it wished.\n\nThere was only one obstacle standing in its way…\n\nTwo obstacles, really.\n\nChanging Star and the Lord of Shadows.\n\nAnd only one of them was here to face the Cursed Demon now.\n\nNephis bathed in the agony of her Flaw, allowing it to purify her mind and steel her resolve. She gathered her flame… she was the flame.\n\nHer soul contained the Fire.\n\n'I need to end it now.'\n\nIn this battle of Will, she needed to want to end the Cursed Demon here and now, want to end it so fiercely that her scorching desire could not be denied.\n\nSo…\n\nNephis reached deep into her heart, remembering every reason she had to want to kill the enemy, and every reason she had to want to prevent the enemy from killing her.\n\nTo be the last one standing.\n\nAnd then, she spoke a Name that she had not been able to invoke before.\n\nShe invoked the Name of Passion."

    "title": "2440 Knowledge of Passion.docx",
    "content": "2440 Knowledge of Passion\n\n\nInvoking the Name of Passion was far more difficult than any other Nephis had ever invoked.\n\nPerhaps it was because, unlike the other Names, the source of this one was Nephis herself.\n\nHer own longing, her own desire, her own yearning, her own passion… she had to know them, to burn with them, to admit them starkly without pretense or falsehood. Then, she had to infuse them into the Name, and channel that Name with her soul.\n\nShaping the world in accordance with the melody of her heart, and forcing the two to resonate with each other.\n\nThe act itself was an immensely difficult one… after all, what human was completely honest with themselves? Completely honest about themselves? Who wasn't scared of bearing themselves and laying the truth of who they were out in the open for the world to see?\n\nFor them themselves to see?\n\nThe first step was difficult, but the second one was arduous. Invoking the Name of Passion meant drawing it out of herself, and channeling it put more strain on Neph's soul and willpower than she had ever felt before while Shaping.\n\nBut she endured.\n\nShe endured the cruelly honest moment of self-reflection, with all her selfishness and weakness put on display, and she endured the strain of channeling the Name of Passion too.\n\nShe invoked it.\n\nShe finally succeeded!\n\nAnd when she did…\n\nIt was as if blinders had been removed from her eyes.\n\nNephis heard the Spell whispering into her ear, but she did not have to listen to its loathsome voice to know that she had mastered another branch of her Aspect Legacy, the Memory of Light.\n\nShe had mastered the Knowledge of Passion.\n\nJust as it had happened with the Knowledge of Fire and the Knowledge of Destruction, she could enjoy the fruit of her labor — a torrent of information poured into her mind, as if a seal had been broken, completing and complementing what she had already intuitively understood.\n\nAn underlying understanding of a multitude of matters, an instinctual grasp of subtle secrets and intricаte techniques, a collection of Names related to passion and desire…\n\nIt was as if she had spent a lifetime striving to explore and fathom something in theory while simultaneously applying that wealth of knowledge in practice — and was now receiving the fruits of this lived experience without the memories themselves.\n\nBut that was not important at the moment. Nephis could assess and consolidate the boon of mastering another branch of her Aspect Legacy later… right now, she was still reeling from having invoked the Name of Passion.\n\nChanneling that Name was like adding fuel to her already scathing desire. Ignited by the invocation of Passion, it flared with even greater intensity, emboldened and empowered by her sorcery.\n\nHer desire, in turn, augmented and emboldened her Will, making it so much more potent.\n\nIt was like a comprehensive enhancement of her fiery spirit… a cheat-like, self-fulfilling prophecy. It was like something that she had always been meant to possess, but was denied until now. The cornerstone of her entire Aspect, or maybe a missing piece that had been preventing her from making the next step.\n\nNephis suddenly felt incredibly alive.\n\nEven the terrible agony of her Flaw seemed less torturous, for a moment. The pain was the same… but the suffering it brought her felt not as meaningless, and therefore more bearable.\n\nDoubtless, uncompromising, burning with passion…\n\nHer Will blossomed with unreserved heat, and that was enough to break the stalemate between her authority and that of the Cursed Demon.\n\nThe world, which had been torn in two, was finally restored to being whole again.\n\nThe frigid hell of Abjuration's creation was vanquished, and the incandescent inferno of purifying flames was actualized, settling to take its lawful place in reality.\n\nAnd so…\n\nJust like Nephis had promised...\n\nAbjuration burned.\n\n***\n\n[...You have slain Abjuration.]\n\nHaving assumed her human form, Nephis fell to her knees and gasped, clutching at her chest. She tried to draw air into her scorched lungs, but there was no air left for her to inhale — all of it had been burned away, turning the ruins of True Bastion into an incandescent, suffocating desert.\n\nThe crumbling castle was no more, turned into a vast plain of glowing, white-hot slag. The lake was gone, too, its dark waters turned into clouds of superheated plasma. The remains of the city that had been hidden below the lake, and the bones of its former citizens, had turned to ash.\n\n'Aargh…'\n\nNephis tried to groаn, but without air to carry her voice, there was no sound.\n\nShe closed her mouth and gritted her teeth, enduring the pain in silence.\n\nEven after she had overpowered the Will of the Cursed Demon by invoking the Name of Passion, their battle lasted for a long while. She had dealt the insidious abominations plenty of grievous wounds, and received more than a few of them herself in return.\n\nHer body was immaculate and pristine, but her soul was in shambles. She had burned her soul cores, as well, damaging a few of them almost to the point of breaking.\n\nBut since she was a halfbreed who was born of two worlds, belonging to neither, she could absorb the soul fragments of Nightmare Creatures slain by her flames just like she would those of humans. Abjuration had been a Cursed Demon, and an ancient one at that… so, her cores were now rebuilding themselves, having received a generous infusion of soul fragments after the abomination's death.\n\n'...Just Abjuration, huh?'\n\nIt seemed like the Spell did not deem it worthy to even mention the Rank and Class of Cursed Nightmare Creatures when announcing their deaths.\n\nIt made sense, really. After all, there was… there had been only one Abjuration in the world. It was one of a kind, so no one would confuse it with some other horror bearing the same name.\n\nNephis looked around, drowning in the heat of the brilliant hell of her own creation.\n\nIt was going to take a long time for True Bastion to cool off…\n\nAnd there was no reason for her to remain here anymore. On the contrary, there were plenty of reasons for her to leave as soon as possible.\n\nEven though she was not channeling the Name of Passion anymore, she could still feel its aftereffects. Usually, she would be drained of all feelings and emotions after abusing her Aspect so thoroughly… but today, Nephis was full of them instead.\n\nShe wanted to return to illusory Bastion. She wanted to revel in delicious food, to satiate her thirst with fragrant wine, to soothe her tired body with the cold caress of water and luxuriate in its embrace…\n\nShe wanted to meet Sunny.\n\nShe longed for him with such intensity that it felt a little frightening.\n\n'Let's go...'\n\nHolding her breath — she had no choice but to — Nephis rose to her feet and looked around one last time.\n\nThe corpse of Abjuration had turned to ash. There were no soul shards left to collect since she had already absorbed the sоul fragments. She was standing near one of the deep cracks formed on the mountain during the siege of Bastion… it was dark and seemingly bottomless, leading far down.\n\nThere was nothing left for her to do here.\n\nNephis turned, intending to return…\n\nBut then, something scraped beneath her feet.\n\nFrowning, she bent down and picked up a small piece of broken glass that had been laying on the edge of the fissure — the only cold thing in the white-hot furnace of the annihilated ruins.\n\nThe piece of glass was blackened by soot, but when she scraped it with a nail, a fiery white eye looked back at her fгom beneath.\n\nIt was the reflection of her own eye, and the white flame dancing in its depths.\n\n'A mirror?'\n\nNephis threw one last look into the dark fissure, her frown growing deeper.\n\nThen, she tossed the fragment of the shattered mirror away and turned around.\n\nIt was time for her to leave.\n\nRavenheart awaited..."

    "content": "2441 Immediate Impact\n\nSunny shook his head as he continued on his way. The memories of learning what Nephis had done in Bastion were followed by the memories of reuniting with her in Ravenheart — at that point, he finally reached his destination.\n\nHaving spent several weeks surrounded by billowing clouds of ash and Cursed abominations, fighting one desperate battle after another, he was truly a pitiful sight to behold. His body might have been rеbuilt and perfected by Flesh Weave, but he still could not wait to take a shower, lower himself into a bath, or better yet, rest his weary self in a steam room, followed by a plunge into ice-cold water.\n\nIt just so happened that he could really use a cold plunge at the moment…\n\nLeaving his battered incarnation to tend to itself, Sunny shifted his focus to the avatar who remained in the council room. The Song sisters had left by then, leaving him alone with Nephis and Cassie.\n\nThe mood in the spacious chamber was different now. The sunset had drawn its last breath, surrendering the world to the embrace of darkness — the sky outside the tall windows was black and littered with shimmering stars, snow dancing in the torrents of cold wind.\n\nThe brief levity was gone, replaced by a sense of gravity. Sunny remained silent for a few moments, then spoke with a sigh — this time, he described what had happened in the miniature realm of Ariel's Game in detail, without wasting his time on jokes or witty wordplay.\n\nGoing over everything he had experienced helped him put the events of the past weeks in perspective, as well.\n\n'Let's see…'\n\nFirst, he explained the nature of the little, dreadful world created by Ariel — the vast grid of towering mountains, the Snow and Ash Domains, the significance of dawn and dusk for the game pieces, the role of Castles and Shrines, and lastly, the existence of the terrifying arbiter who hid beneath the clouds. These were the laws governing the Death Game.\n\nThen, he described his own actions in the game and the battles he had fought.\n\nThe battle against the Crystal Hive was relatively insignificant, in the grand scheme of things. At best, it was a valuable exercise in fighting a powerful adversary while being suppressed by a hostile Domain — which wasn't really that new of an experience for Sunny or for Nephis, who suffered a much worse version of the same suppression every time they entered the waking world.\n\nNext was the battle against Abundance. That one was a much more valuable lesson… a priceless one, even, since it was the first time Sunny had fought a Cursed abomination. He had learned about how lesser deities embodied concepts and weaponized them to twist the absolute laws of existence in their favor from that clash, as well as understood the natural affinity of his own Will better.\n\nIn the end, Sunny had defeated Abundance by utilizing sorcery to counter and restrain the Beast's authority, then slowly poisoning its soul with Death Will.\n\nNephis smiled faintly when he described crushing the infinite worm under his boot.\n\n\"...What an elegant solution.\"\n\nSunny chuckled.\n\n\"Thank you. Killing Abundance was the pebble that began an avalanche. With a Sacred shade in my service, I could tackle more powerful foes and slowly build an advantage over the Snow Tyrant. Plus... it was quite satisfying!\"\n\nHe continued, describing the race to the Shrine of Truth and its first siege — his battle against the Wolf, the grand spell he had woven, and the eventual annihilation of the volcano.\n\nThe details of how he had held off a Cursed Demon while fueling his trap with the Demon's own strength had a greater effect on Nephis and Cassie.\n\nCassie especially seemed stunned.\n\n\"So, you… channeled an opposite concept to that of the Wolf?\"\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n\"When you fight deities, the battle itself is only the tip of the iceberg. There is a clash of Wills happening at the same time, hidden from view — it influences the cadence of combat, deciding who will gain the decisive advantage. Gods reshape the world around them according to what they are, and in order to defeat them, you have to break that vision of reality first. One would ideally achieve that with overwhelming strength… but since we are weaker than the Cursed Ones, I had to get inventive.\"\n\nCassie smiled.\n\n\"Amazing…\"\n\nNephis, meanwhile, contemplated his words deeply.\n\nEventually, a sigh escaped from her lips, and she gave Sunny a long look.\n\nIt was sort of... boastful? Satisfied? A little prideful?\n\nHowever, Nephis did not seem proud of herself. Rather, she seemed to be proud of Sunny... and satisfied with herself as a result?\n\n'What has gotten into her?'\n\n\"It is an incredible technique, Sunny. Sadly… I don't think anyone except you can make use of it. Your Aspect and Aspect Legacy make you supremely adaptable, and this arcane ability to channel foreign concepts is their culmination. No one else would have been able to do something like that.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a few moments.\n\nWell... she wasn't wrong. Granted, he did not explain how he had almost killed Kai after taking this technique a step further in the battle against the Puppeteer yet — but that could wait a little longer.\n\nAfter all, who didn't like being praised by their girlfriend and receiving these kinds of looks from her? Sunny wanted to enjoy the second a little longer.\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"The spell I created takes most credit for the deaths of the Wolf and the Brass Giant. It was a significant breakthrough in and of itself, made possible by the lessons I had learned while creating a bow for Kai. Actually… out of everything I gained in Ariel's Game, this one might be the most immediately impactful.\"\n\nNephis gave him an intense look.\n\n\"Do you mean?\"\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n\"Yes. It opens an entirely new horizon of possibilities for us. I can further develop and expand this new branch of Weaving… then, I'll be able to create more intricate spells. Even with seven bodies, I won't be able to enchant every Citadel of humanity — but doing so for our most important strongholds in the Dream Realm might be possible, as long as there are enough Sacred soul shards to fuel the spells.\"\n\nNephis looked to Cassie.\n\n\"Cassie, do you think you can help Sunny integrate his enchantments into the fortifications of human Citadels with runic sorcery?\"\n\nThe blind seer considered her words seriously for a while, then gave her a hesitant shrug.\n\n\"It is… not impossible. Fusing two schools of sorcery won't make the result greater, but it might hasten the process and make it easier for the Saints in charge of the Citadels to operate and maintain the arrays. Sunny and I will have to spend a lot of time side by side to work out the framework, though. I've… I've never considered large-scale runic arrays thoroughly before, but it should not be entirely different from the sorcery of the Ivory Island and the Chain Breaker.\"\n\nNephis sighed.\n\n\"Time… it all comes down to time, doesn't it?\"\n\nShe fell silent for a moment.\n\n\"Still, that is something worth investing time in. Our cities will come under siege eventually — when that happens, there has to be a way to keep the population safe while the champions repel the enemy. Sunny, I would be grateful if you and Cassie made that project a priority.\"\n\nSunny smiled.\n\n\"Sure. I can spare an incarnation or two.\"\n\nIn fact, he was glad to receive this opportunity.\n\nSunny did not pursue fame or recognition. Being forced into the shadows by the revelation of why Weaver's Lineage had been forbidden by the gods suited him fine — if not for the fact that he could not exert as much influence from the shadows freely as he would have wanted to.\n\nHumanity was protected by two Sovereigns, but one of them was severely constrained in what he could do to actually help people. So, working on fortifying human cities in the Dream Realm was a good way to apply his power for the benefit of all in a secretive, but efficient manner.\n\nSunny's expression turned somber as he continued his tale, describing the eerie encounter with the Cursed Demon and the days missing from his memory. Then, he told Nephis and Cassie about the battle against the Rat King and how he and Kai had utilized the inherent vulnerability of that Cursed Beast to destroy it.\n\nAs he did, he summoned the shade of the Rat King to illustrate his point…\n\nStrangely enough, the appearance of a large, feral-looking black rat on his palm did not impress the two women that much. In fact, their reactions did not seem enthusiastic at all, for some reason.\n\nIt was almost as if they did not like this adorable black cutie-pie!\n\nBut why wouldn't they?\n\n'Weirdos…'\n\nDismissing the Rat after giving it a few head scratches, Sunny considered his words and described the final battle of Ariel's Game — the battle against the Spirit of Doubt, Puppeteer itself."

    "content": "2442 Self-Sufficient Cycle\n\n\n\"...And so, I cleaved the Snow Tyrant's head clean off.\"\n\nHe finished the description оf the battle with a thoughtful expression, looking at the stars burning in the cold black sky beyond the window.\n\n\"I think that it was mostly lying through its teeth to confuse me — well, actually, I don't think that it had a mouth, so it was lying through whatever it had instead of teeth. Puppeteer was definitely not as immune to the madness of Corruption as it presented itself, at least. As for the rest…\"\n\nHe frowned.\n\n\"...Maybe there was some truth to what it said, after all. Even if it twisted the meaning of it all entirely to sow seeds of doubt into my mind.\"\n\nSpeaking of which, Sunny had felt a few of those still growing in his heart after returning from Ariel's Game — soon to give birth to larval Worm's of Doubt, certainly. He poisoned them with Death Will and obliterated them completely, shivering in fear and disgust, then asked Nephis to purify him with her radiant flames just in case. Kai underwent the same cleansing.\n\nThat did the job, preventing the Puppeteer from infecting the world with its sinister malice from beyond the grave. Things could have gone differently if it had met a less paranoid — and well-informed — adversary.\n\nThere was silence in the council chamber for a while.\n\nThen, Nephis said in a contemplative tone:\n\n\"Actually, I'm inclined to believe at least one thing the moth told you.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Oh? Which one?\"\n\nShe looked into the distance, a distant expression on her beautiful face.\n\n\"What it said about the Flame waning. If you think about it… that is only natural, no?\"\n\nSunny studied her carefully.\n\n\"I'm not sure. Natural? How so?\"\n\nNephis let out a light sigh.\n\n\"Our world was created by the gods, who were born from the Flame of Desire. But a flame does indeed need fuel to burn — it cannot exist in a vacuum. So, what fuel was there for the Flame of Desire to burn, all those eons ago, before time even existed?\"\n\nSunny tilted his head a little, confused by her words.\n\n'What fuel...'\n\nThen, his eyes widened slightly.\n\nWhat else could there have been, in the eternity before time existed?\n\nHe whispered:\n\n\"The… Void?\"\n\nNephis nodded.\n\n\"That would make sense. An everlasting, endless source of fuel for an immortal, inexhaustible flame.\"\n\nHer eyes flared with a promise of white flames, as well.\n\n\"But there was also an irrevocable conflict between the ever-changing Void and the eternally constant Desire. So, the gods waged a war against the Void and eventually imprisoned it… separating the Flame from the Void by nothing. Now, the Flame burns in a vacuum, deprived of its fuel... of its source. So, the Flame is waning, and at the same time, the Flame is sustaining itself, by itself... from itself.\"\n\nCassie spoke at that moment, her voice sounding soft in the silence of the council chamber:\n\n\"But it does sustain itself. It's a closed, self-sufficient cycle. We are all a part of the Flame, and our own desires fuel it. The Puppeteer tried its hardest to paint that truth as something vilе and appalling, but I think it's the opposite. To me, it seems… it seems beautiful. A flame that ensures itself, burning brightly with human striving and longing...\"\n\nShe faced them and smiled hesitantly.\n\n\"Don't you think so?\"\n\nNephis looked at the stars, while Sunny shrugged.\n\n\"Well, we are indeed of the Flame — of this vast and strange existence the gods created. So the Puppeteer's whole argument was meaningless behind its sophistry, since he was trying to convince me that being destroyed and consumed by the Void is a better alternative to being alive… simply because being alive is not all sunshine and roses.\"\n\nHe scoffed.\n\n\"I don't know about you, but sunshine is overrated… I'd much rather relax in the shade. And as far as roses go, most of the flowers I encountered in my life had tried to either eat me, shred me to pieces with their thorns, or get their pollen into my body to use it as fertilizer — none of which is conducive to being alive, as it happens.\"\n\nSunny smiled.\n\nYes, life was cruel at times… life was a constant struggle, and for some people — people like him — it was more often bitter than sweet.\n\n…But it was, after all, sweet.\n\nLife was also beautiful, joyful, and exciting, full of precious things like affection, contentment, accomplishment, fun… it contained friendship, camaraderie, love, passion; there was beauty, intellectual pursuits, challenge, and thrill…\n\nEven though Sunny's life had not been an easy one, it had also been a life full of great pleasure and joy. One side of his life could not have existed without the other, and the struggles he had overcome to be where he was gave meaning to it all, making each triumph feel so much more satisfying.\n\nThat too was the Flame…\n\nAnd that was what he had to protect from being consumed by Corruption, from becoming swallowed by the alien malice of the primordial Void.\n\nHe sighed and looked at Nephis. \"You had a run-in with a Cursed One yourself, didn't you? What do you think?\"\n\nSunny had killed four Cursed Nightmare Creatures in Ariel's Game — Abundance, the Wolf, the Rat King, and the Puppeteer. The Brass Giant had perished as a result of his actions, as well, while three more fallen deities had died in a mysterious way.\n\nIt was a breathtaking achievement, no doubt… and yet, Sunny did not feel a lot of confidence at the moment.\n\nIn fact, he was left properly shaken by his experiences in the Death Game.\n\nIn truth, while Sunny had been at a great disadvantage in the dreadful world of Ariel's creation, its laws had also worked in his favor. The Cursed Ones had been restrained in how they could move and what they could do, for one. The nature of the Ash Domain made the battle for the Shrine of Truth easier, while the Shrine itself had empowered his companions tremendously…\n\nAnd even then, he had just barely survived.\n\nIf Sunny had met the same Cursed Ones in the wild reaches of the Dream Realm, who knew how things would have turned out?\n\nNephis remained silent for a while, then said in a somber tone:\n\n\"It was… much more dangerous than I had imagined. In truth, I am lucky to be alive.\"\n\nHer expression darkened.\n\n\"That single Cursed Demon could have wiped out all of humanity. I defeated it, yes — but my victory was not assured. The battle was a close one, in fact, no different from a gamble.\"\n\nShe pursed her lips.\n\n\"In short, the Cursed Ones are too dangerous. Every single one of them is an extinction-level threat, despite how powerful you and I have become. And there are more than a few of them out there, as well. There are five just here in the Jade Palace at the moment… gods only кnow how many remain in Godgrave, both in the Hollows and in the Sea of Ash.\"\n\nNephis scowled.\n\n\"There are also the Death Zones south of Godgrave, the frozen wastelands west of Ravenheart, the Hollow Mountains and the Underworld, the Burned Forest, the Abyss and the Shadow Realm, the unexplored reaches… and depths… of the Stormsea, and other regions of the Dream Realm we have not even discovered yet.\"\n\nFinally, she looked at Suny and let out a tired sigh.\n\n\"If all of them — or even only some of them — suddenly converge on the Human Domain, we will stand no chance. And that… that is not even mentioning the Unholy Ones. Considering how vast the gap between the Great and Cursed Nightmare Creatures is already, I'm afraid that both of us combined won't be strong enough to face even a single one.\"\n\nSunny remained silent, a grim expression on his face. It was not that he did not have anything to say… it was just that he agreed with Nephis. The two of them were the strongest warriors of humanity — by far — and they were barely powerful enough to contend against isolated Cursed abominations.\n\nWhat would happen if an Unholy Nightmare Creature revealed itself, instead?\n\nHe shivered.\n\nNephis, meanwhile, shook her head.\n\n\"...Which is to say that our reasoning was correct. Being Supreme is not at all enough to achieve our goals. We must become more powerful… much more powerful. And we must gain that power as fast as we can.\"\n\nShe looked at him, hesitated for a moment, and then added in a lower tone:\n\n\"Or… at least one of us must. If they are willing.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, leaning on the backrest of the Shadow Chair. Many thoughts wandered around his mind aimlessly, but he still could not come up with thе answer.\n\nIn the end, he said:\n\n\"There is something else about my experience in Ariel's Game that I must tell you. Something… quite important. Maybe even more important than anything we have known until now.\"\n\nHe inhaled deeply, and then looked at Nephis and Cassie.\n\n\"It concerns a group of people who called themselves the Nine, Weaver, and the Nightmare Spell…\""

    "content": "2443 Summary of Everything\n\nSunny had spent more than a decade uncovering the dreadful secrets of the Dream Realm and slowly piecing together its truth. The road to the knowledge he now possessed had been paved with blood and smoldering ruins, and very few people — if any at all — knew as much as he did about the hidden nature of the world.\n\nWhich was not to say that others had not searched for the truth with just as much determination, and that no one else had a claim to the forbidden knowledge he harbored.\n\nThe late Sovereigns had known countless secrets, for example. There was Nephis, as well… she knew nearly as much as Sunny did, having spent the years they had been apart pursuing truths of her own. He did not have a monopoly on arcane knowledge, and neither did the world stand frozen while he was away.\n\nIt was just that Sunny had an overwhelming advantage when it came to solving the chilling mysteries of the past… or at least used to have. That advantage was his former innate Attribute, [Fated], which had put him on a collision course with Weaver and other main characters of the end of the world all those years ago.\n\nHowever, Nephis had a great advantage of her own. That advantage… was Cassie. There was hardly a person in the world better suited to learning the lost and forgotten truths than her — so, Nephis and Cassie had learned quite a few of the same secrets Sunny had, in the years of his absence.\n\nLater, the three of them put their knowledge together.\n\n…Now, however, Sunny was once again far ahead.\n\nBecause this time, the secret he had learned was truly world-shattering.\n\nIt was a secret to end all secrets, as well as the answer to numerous mysteries that had been plaguing them for years.\n\nSo, Sunny told them everything he had learned in Ariel's Game.\n\nHow Weaver had challenged the Demon of Dread to a Death Game. Who the Nine were … how Weaver died for the first time by Orphne's hand. How she killed the Demon of Fate once again in the Shadow Realm, how the Nightmare Spell was completed by consuming the gods…\n\nAnd why.\n\nOf course, he could only tell them the truth without explaining how all of it related to him personally — Cassie had already deduced a lot about who Sunny was and had been from the gaps in her memory аnd the things she did not seem capable of remembering, while Nephis had her suspicions as well… but still, neither of them could retain the knоwledge of what they had known about him in the past.\n\nWhen he finished talking, a stunned silence reigned in the council chamber. A snowstorm was raging outside the window, obscuring the starlit sky… the chamber seemed darker than before, with shadows nestling in its corners, and no one dared to speak for a long while.\n\nEventually, it was Sunny himself who broke the silence.\n\n\"Aahh... I've been chasing this truth for so long, you know. It almost feels unreal, to finally know it all — well, most of it, at least. I… I don't quite know how to feel. But I do know that knowledge is the origin of all power. So, it feels like we have grown immensely more powerful despite remaining the same, I guess.\"\n\nCassie was frozen still, her expression distant. She seemed to be thinking about something feverishly, thousands of thoughts swarming behind her beautiful, unseeing eyes.\n\nSunny shuddered to imagine what was happening in the little, devious head of hers.\n\nNepis, meanwhile, was somber and focused, looking at Sunny with silent, but scathing intensity.\n\nAfter a while, she inhaled slowly, and then spoke quietly:\n\n\"So… let me get this straight.\"\n\nShe stood up and walked to the window, watching the snowstorm rage behind the transparent crystal pane. Her voice sounded just as aloof as usual, but there was a wealth of hidden emotion in it now:\n\n\"A long time ago, at the dusk of the Golden Age, the gods had grown distant and indifferent, neglecting their duties… what people considered to be their duties, at least. In their neglectful absence, an empire founded by War God and presumably enjoying his patronage launched a series of bloody conquests, slowly spreading across the mortal realms like a plague. That conquest continued until they encountered a small, peaceful nation… a culture that worshiped no gods, but instead built temples to fate itself.\"\n\nShe turned and looked at Sunny with a frown.\n\n\"That culture was conquered and wiped out, but not before sending out nine fated heroes… or monsters, depending on how you look at it… on a quest to avenge their people. Avenge their people by slaying the gods.\"\n\nSunny nodded and continued:\n\n\"But how can mortals hope to defeat the gods? The Nine were no match for them, and so, they set out to ignite a war between the daemons and the gods, knowing that it would bring the Empire of War — and all of existence with it — to ruin. In that way, they became the architects of the doom that swallowed the world.\"\n\nNephis smiled darkly.\n\n\"Only there was one daemon who refused to participate in the Doom War. That daemon, in fact, knew what the Nine were trying to achieve all along, as well as that there would be no winner in the war… that everything would be destroyed by it, with only corpses left in its wake. So, that daemon devised a plan of their own, a plan to twist fate.\"\n\nShe inhaled deeply and finished in a cold, grim tone:\n\n\"Weaver created the Nightmare Spell, let it spread unnoticed among the desperate refugees of the end of days, and then manipulated one of the Nine into slaying them in the Shadow Realm, where the Void Gate stands — the Void Gate that had been opened by someone during the final battle of the Doom War. Weaver's death was a catalyst that completed the Spell, allowing it to consume both the gods and the daemons... and realize its true design.\"\n\nCassie finally stirred, tilting her head a little and whispering:\n\n\"To lull the Forgotten God, who was released from the Void, back to sleep. And then infect the humans who found shelter in the orphaned Divine Realms in an attempt to nurture new gods… gods who were taught to defy fate, and would therefore be able to destroy the Forgotten One once and for all in the depths of the Seventh Nightmare.\"\n\nNeph's expression turned cold.\n\n\"...Only it did not work out quite like Weaver had hoped, until now. Every Divine Realm infected by the Spell succumbed to the flood of nightmares and was devoured by the Dream Realm, after all, their civilizations annihilated and consumed by Corruption. The people of the Twilight Sea, the civilization of Godgrave, and the rest — all of them are gone, and we are all that remains. The last sparks of the Flame.\"\n\nSunny sighed, then nodded.\n\n\"You do understand what it means, don't you?\"\n\nCassie was the one who answered:\n\n\"It means that humanity is fundamentally wrong about the mechanism and the purpose of the Spell, for one. In truth, what we call the Nightmare Spell is really two connected, but separate processes… we had suspicions, of course, but now it's confirmed. The Forgotten God sleeps, dreaming a nightmare — vestiges of his dreams spill into reality, slowly infecting all of existence. That is where the Nightmare Seeds come from, tainting everything around them with Corruption. And when the Seeds bloom, the Forgotten God's Nightmare continues to spread — Gates open in new realms, and those worlds are then integrated into his own Divine Realm… into the Dream Realm.\"\n\nSunny leaned back, looking into the distance.\n\n\"So, the Nightmare Spell does not create the Nightmare Seeds, and neither does it create Nightmare Creatures. Rather, it is… like an interface built atop of it all, through it all, like a symbiotic — or maybe parasitic — presence. It constructs Nightmares within the Seeds and grants its carriers a way to access these Nightmares in order to destroy the Seeds from within. That is why those... those who do not carry the Spell cannot challenge a Seed — if they approach one, they will simply be exposing themselves to Corruption.\"\n\nCassie drew a shaky breath.\n\n\"That is one of the main functions of the Spell. The second function is to nurture its carriers in various ways and help them walk the Path of Ascension at a speed unthinkable for natural Awakened… in the most ruthless, but also quite an effective way.\"\n\nShe exhaled slowly before adding:\n\n\"The third of its main functions…\"\n\nSunny ended the sentence.\n\n\"Is the most fundamental one, which lies at the root of it all. It is to keep the Forgotten God asleep.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, and then said with a hint of fascination in his voice:\n\n\"Many questions about how the Spell functions remain, of course. For example, what powers it? Does it consume a bit of the soul fragments of evеry living being slain by its carriers, perhaps? Or is it using the Nightmare of the Forgotten God as a perpetual battery to fuel itself? Is it still intact, or has its mechanism been corrupted over the eons? How exactly does it create the Nightmares, and what is the nature of the phantoms populating them? I am pretty sure that the Spell was not woven out of essence strings, but from the Strings of Fate themselves… is that why it seems omniscient, possessing the knowledge of both the past and the future?\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"Weaver, that sinister daemon… they pulled quite a stunning trick back then, at the end. Didn't they? Compared to what the Spell is, even the act of slaying the gods — and the daemons — almost seems to pale in comparison. I mean, who could have guessed that killing the gods had been merely the means to an end, not the actual goal? And who could have been brazen enough to treat their deaths that way?\"\n\nHe sighed, suddenly feeling suffocated.\n\nSunny was Fateless now… but that did not seem to free him from Weaver's grasp. The nebulous daemon had envisioned a role for their inheritor — their epigone — and even after being torn from the tapestry of fate, Sunny was still marching to the beat of their drum. That was because Weaver did not need to manipulate his fate in order to control him. They could simply manipulatе the entire world and leave Sunny no choice but to go where the Demon of Fate had wanted him to go. Even though he was not Fated anymore, the weight of the decisions Sunny had already made ensured that his future choices would be in line with what Weaver had envisioned.\n\n'That damn daemon…'\n\nHe exhaled slowly.\n\n\"All of it is fascinating, and there's a lot we still don't know. But these details are not exactly important right now, are they?\"\n\nNephis, who had kept quiet until then, gave him a poignant look.\n\n\"What is important, then?\"\n\nSunny met her gaze, choosing his words carefully.\n\nIn the end, he spoke in a tone that was a little softer than usual.\n\n\"Well… you are. Your goal has always been to destroy the Spell. Now that you know that it is not as malignаnt as we believed, and that its existence is necessary to keep the Forgotten God from swallowing us all, doesn't it change anything? Or rather... doesn't it change everything?\"\n\nNephis studied him for a while, her expression unreadable.\n\nThen, she pursed her lips slightly and turned to the window.\n\n\"...It doesn't really change much, though.\""

    "content": "2444 Dream of the Forgotten God\n\nSunny stared at her, stunned.\n\n\"It… doesn't change much? How so?\"\n\nNephis lingered for a long time, then shrugged.\n\n\"My goal has always been to destroy the Nightmare Spell. But… back when I chose that goal, I was young and knew little of the world. As I grew and learned more, my understanding of the world expanded… and therefore, my goals expanded as well. The Nightmare Spell, the Nightmares — to me, they are one and the same. I want to destroy them all. And even if the root evil is the Nightmare itself, the Spell is not free of guilt either.\"\n\nHer voice grew a little lower.\n\n\"You two seem to accept that the Nightmare Spell is a benevolent force, but I disagree. Yes, with what we know now, it is impossible to deny that its purpose, at least, was a noble one. It was created to save the world, no less. However, you forget that it was created by a daemon, a divine being as old as time itself… and their concept of benevolence and nobility would have been quite alien to ours.\"\n\nTurning аround, she looked at Sunny and Cassie coldly.\n\n\"Sure, the Nightmare Spell pushes humans to walk the Path of Ascension as fast as possible — in order to give us strength to resist the spreading Nightmare. But have you considered that it might not be going about it in the best possible way? As far as I see it, the Spell's solution to the problem is to simply throw as many bodies at it as possible. Most will die gruesomely, and then, even more people will die. Countless lives will be ruined, and entire generations will be wiped out. But as long as a few survive and achieve a higher Rank… then everything is okay, isn't it?\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a few moments, considering her words. Then, he said tentatively:\n\n\"But you can't deny that it's… effective, can you? And that we are in a pretty desperate situation, so it's not like we are spoiled for choices.\"\n\nNephis shook her head.\n\n\"Is it that effective, though? Or is it crude and wasteful? Think back to everything you have experienced. Was there really no better way? We are the strongest champions of humanity, you and I. But is it because we were the best, or is it because we were lucky? Would things have been different if the Spell had been different? All those lost lives… all that wasted potential. How would the world have turned out if the First Lord of the Bright Castle had not been sent into a death trap by the Spell, for example? How far could he and his cohort have gone? What about Daeron the Serpent King? If the Spell had not sent him into a Nightmare that only someone immune to Corruption could have conquered, what would have happened to the people of the Twilight Sea?\"\n\nShe shook her head and gritted her teeth.\n\n\"You can only see the Spell in a positive light because you are its beneficiary, not its victim. No matter its purpose, the Spell is ruthless, inhuman, and vile. All this great power, all that startling potential… and you tell me that the great Demon of Fate could not come up with anything better than forcing children into the jaws of the Nightmare? Do you know how many Aspirants die every year without ever becoming Sleepers? I know, because I can feel their flames being snuffed out day and night. Was there really no better way?\"\n\nWhite flames ignited in Neph's eyes, and she grimaced.\n\n\"You can convince me that the Nightmare Spell is a necessary evil that we are stuck with, but you can't convince me that it is benign. You can't convince me not to hate it.\"\n\nThen, suddenly, her expression eased, turning cold and impassive once again. Nephis remained silent for a few moments, then sighed and turned back to the window.\n\n\"Well… it doesn't matter, anyway. I meant it when I said that this new knowledge doesn't change much — in any case of how I feel about the Spell. A long time ago, I told someone that I intended to conquer all the Nightmares, and destroy the Spell. And I still do. It is just that now, I know that there will be a seventh Nightmare after the sixth, and that I will have to end the Forgotten God first before dismantling the Spell.\"\n\nShe chuckled bitterly.\n\n\"There would be no need for it by then anymore, anyway. So this entire argument is moot.\"\n\nSunny frowned, then leaned forward a little.\n\n\"But that is just the thing, Neph. It is not moot. Have you forgotten what our goal is? It is to prevent the destruction of humanity. Killing the Forgotten God is what Weaver's wanted to achieve, not us. Who cares what that treacherous daemon wanted? Weaver is dead, so we are free to do what we want. And to achieve that… we don't need to risk ourselves in a battle against a being that neither the gods nor the daemons were able to stop.\"\n\nHe clenched his fists.\n\n\"We don't need to conquer the Seven Nightmares and destroy the Forgotten God. We don't need to destroy the Spell, either — the Spell can continue keeping that thing asleep. It has contained him for eons, and it can contain him for a few eons more. We just need to become strong enough to contend against the creatures that are threatening humanity here and now… we just need to become Divine.\"\n\nOthers would have called him a fool or a coward for thinking like that, but Sunny did not care. In fact, he considered people who could not see past what was intended for them foolish, instead.\n\nSure, the Forgotten God was the source of Corruption that plagued the world, and destroying him would theoretically stop the spread of the Nightmare… but so what?\n\nNone of them had even considered the possibility of a world without Nightmare Seeds and Nightmare Creatures before. These were merely inalienable facts of life until just a few days ago, and rather than fantasizing about some kind of heavenly paradise, they had been busy planning how to ensure the survival and prosperity of mankind in reality.\n\nAs long as its safe resettlement into the Dream Realm could be ensured, and as long as there were champions powerful enough to keep the Cursed and Unholy Nightmare Creatures at bay, humanity could not only survive, but thrive in this world they lived in.\n\nThere were already vast cities like Bastion and Ravenheart here, in the Dream Realm… there were electric street lights and fertile fields, roads were being built across the wilderness, trade caravans were traveling between human strongholds, and new settlers were arriving every day. Sure, there were also Nightmare Creatures and horrors beyond description… but that was just life.\n\nHe had never known anything different, and most of humanity had not either. And yet, that did not stop people from living their lives… from struggling, striving, and thriving in this dangerous, but generous and stunning world.\n\nThat was what Sunny wanted to protect. That was why he had returned from his journey to the edge of the world, resolving to change it.\n\nSlaying some ancient God of Corruption had nothing to do with it. Sunny could sleep peacefully even knowing that the Forgotten God was dreaming about him somewhere out there, imprisoned in a Nightmare by the Spell.\n\nSure, there was a possibility that the Spell would fail one day and that its prisoner would awaken… but that was not an unfamiliar reality, either. After all, even before the Nightmare Spell descended, people knew that the sun would die one day, and that the entire universe was moving toward eventual demise.\n\nBut nobody threw themselves into the sun because of it. The world had always been meant to end one day… probably long after humanity had already destroyed itself ten times over. The awakening of the Forgotten God was no different from the heat death of the universe, in that regard.\n\nOnly destroying the Forgotten God would probably be far more difficult and deadly than destroying the universe. After all, he was older than the universe, having participated in its creation.\n\n…And that was whom Weaver wanted them to kill?\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"Becoming Divine is already impossible enough. Sure, I understand that we are indoctrinated to count and do everything in sevens, and that it feels wrong to ignore the logical conclusion of the path laid out for us by Weaver… but our goal has been to become gods in order to protect humanity. Not to challenge the final Nightmare and correct an error made by the true gods when designing the world. Not to eliminate the Flaw of existence. A perfect world is a dead world, anyway, so why would we want to throw ourselves into something entirely fatal, and meaningless on top of that?\"\n\nNephis looked at him with a deep scowl.\n\n\"To prevent numerous people from having their choice robbed from them by the Nightmare Spell. To save countless lives from dying in the Nightmares. To ensure that the end of the world never comes. To destroy the Spell once and for all! Why… why can't you see it?\"\n\nSunny did not respond for a while, looking at her silently.\n\nHe knew… he knew that deep down, Nephis was a selfish person. That she did what she wanted, and it was merely a happy coincidence that what she wanted was to be a righteous and decent person — according to her own harsh understanding of righteousness and decency, of course.\n\nBut what she really wanted was to destroy the Spell, which she hated — and do so in a way she would not be ashamed of.\n\nTo avenge herself upon the world.\n\nThe Nightmare Gates, the Nightmare Spell, it was indeed all the same to her. She would not be able to let go of her most ardent desire easily.\n\nBut…\n\nSunny was a selfish person, too.\n\n\"I see it. But I… I simply don't want you to throw your life away, Neph. Not in an attempt to create some kind of flawless Garden of Eden, of all things. I need you alive… please, try to see that as well.\"\n\nThey both remained silent for a while, looking at each other.\n\nIn the end, Nephis sighed and turned away.\n\n\"...Why are we arguing, anyway? It's not even guaranteed that we will survive the Fifth Nightmare, let alone the Sixth. We can't even think about challenging the Seventh right now, and won't be for many years. So… let's cross that bridge when we get there.\"\n\nSunny lingered for a while, then nodded reluctantly.\n\n\"Sure. Let's focus on what we need to do right now, indeed.\"\n\nHe knew that she had not been convinced, and that her determination to destroy the Nightmare Spell was as firm as ever.\n\nBut… Sunny also knew that many things could change with time. So, he tacitly agreed not to continue this conversation later, for now.\n\nNephis sighed.\n\n\"So, what are your plans?\"\n\nHe leaned back and smiled.\n\n\"Well, since you so kindly disposed of that Cursed Demon and cleared the path to the Mirror Maze, I thought I'd get Effie and explore True Bastion a little. Oh… but I want to make a short stop in the frozen wastelands west of here first. There's something there I want to try finding. I'll depart for Bastion after that.\"\n\nNephis hesitated for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"Good. Actually, I found something after the battle with Abjuration. A fragment of one of Mordret's Reflections. It could have been there from when we unleashed that Cursed Demon in True Bastion a year ago, but something tells me that it got there later. So, he might be hiding somewhere in that Mirror Maze… it's good that you'll be heading there.\"\n\nSunny's smile dimmed a little.\n\n\"That guy? How wonderful.\"\n\nWith that, he turned to Cassie.\n\n\"He was not hiding in that piece of mirror by chance, was he?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"No… Abjuration would have gotten him, and I checked just to make sure on top of that.\"\n\nSunny nodded with relief.\n\n\"Good. Then… I guess we are done for today. I think we all need some time to digest all this new information.\"\n\nHe looked at Nephis, knowing that the two of them had a lot to talk about... and talk through. But that was better done alone.\n\nOutside the window, the sun was already rising from beyond the horizon.\n\nA new day had come to Ravenheart."

    "title": "2445 Longer Days.docx",
    "content": "2445 Longer Days\n\n\nAbout a month later, just before the full moon, Sunny returned to Bastion.\n\nOr rather, another of his incarnations did. The first had actually returned to Bastion weeks ago, but this one took a detour to the frozen wastelands west of Ravenheart first.\n\nThere were scouting parties of the Human Domain prowling there in search of Citadels — granted, they neither dared nor could survive going deep into the hellish cold, and only the Saints ventured beyond the outer reaches of the seemingly boundless expanse of ice.\n\nSo, Sunnу had employed Silent Stalker as a guide... well, more so informed her of the fact that she would be his guide... and the two of them spent several unforgettable weeks together, shivering in the cold and eluding the strange, fearsome Nightmare Creatures who reigned in that frozen hell.\n\nThat was how Sunny learned that Silent Stalker was not, in fact, mute. As it turned out, she could talk after all — or, at least, she could hiss and curse like a sailor.\n\nWhatever made the usually taciturn Song princess so expressive all of a sudden… he had no idea.\n\nIt was probably the cold.\n\nIn any case, eventually, when it became too dangerous for Silent Stalker to follow him, he left her in a shelter he had dug in the ice and continued west on his own. A few days later, a pale and shaken Sunny returned, and the two of them started on the way back to Ravenheart.\n\nFrom there, Sunny passed through the Dream Gate to Bastion — it opened regularly, connecting the two largest human cities in the Dream Realm at set intervals.\n\nAnd here he was.\n\nA mass of people were flowing out of the towering Dream Gate, and he was safely hidden in its middle. Sunny was wearing a ragged robe atop the Nebulous Mantle, having already changed his facial features — members of the Shadow Clan used special Memories for that, but he simply reshaped his avatar a little for the sake of anonymity. Masking his appearance had become much easier after he lеarned how to grant manifested shadows color in Ariel's Game.\n\nMaking himself less handsome felt like a crime against humanity, but what could he do? Such was life… plus, he was a taken man now, so drawing admiring gazes would do him no good.\n\nThere was a long, narrow object wrapped in cloth tied to his back, protruding high above his head. Sunny walked as if it was a light as a feather, but in fact, it took all of his Supreme strength not to stagger under thе weight of the damn thing. Even the wild shadow he had attached to his feet and controlled to mimic his movements seemed to be sweating from the burden of the object's shadow.\n\n'Holy hell… why is this thing so heavy?'\n\nLetting out a shaky sigh, Sunny allowed the current of the crowd to carry him away from the Dream Gate. Soon enough, he encountered a problem.\n\nStanding on the waterfront, he watched ferries move across the lake. He had to cross the lake, as well, but no ferry would be able to support his weight. At best, the deck would crack beneath him… at worst, the entire ferry would sink, taking the passengers with it.\n\nIn fact, the only reason why the ground was not fracturing beneath his feet already was that he was in the Castle, where the cobblestones were made from the same mystical stone as the walls of the great fortress itself.\n\nSunny scratched the back of his head.\n\n'Should I just Shadow Step to my destination?'\n\nFailing to come up with a better idea, he went to find a dark alley where no one would notice him vanishing into thin air. It would do no one any good if he was seen using powers similar to those of the Lord of Shadows.\n\nBeing dead was such a hassle sometimes.\n\nAs Sunny walked, he thought about what had transpired in the past month.\n\nMany things had happened while his incarnation was enduring the cold of the frozen hellscape. Early winter was the busiest time for the Human Domain, after all, because of the winter solstice.\n\nBy now, most of the Sleepers who had been infеcted by the Nightmare Spell last year were either Awakened… or dead. Others were still somewhere out there, in the Dream Realm, making their way to human Citadels. Some had Awakened long before the solstice, having passed through the Dream Gate in advance — in fact, there were many of them, significantly reducing thе death toll.\n\nThis winter solstice in particular was especially important because it served as proof of concept. It was the second solstice of Neph's reign, but the first one she was able to prepare for — the previous one had happened too soon after the end of the Domain War, when everything was in chaos.\n\nNot that things weren't chaotic now.\n\nDepending on the results of all the measures Nephis and Cassie had taken to ensure that as many Sleepers as possible survived their first journey to the Dream Realm, all following solstices could drastically transform…\n\nThere weren't many of those left for humanity, though, since the waking world was going to be consumed by the Dream Realm before too long.\n\nBut that was merely the significance of the winter solstice to all of humanity. It was meaningful to Sunny on a personal level, as well — after all, it was his birthday.\n\nHe had turned twenty-eight.\n\nThis time, Sunny had enjoyed several birthday parties at the same time — one in the Dark City, with Aiko, his Shadows and incarnations, and the strangely stiff members of the Shadow Clan; one in Ravenheart, with Nephis, Cassie, and Kai; and one with Silent Stalker of all people, who had not seemed enthused about his insistence of celebrating a birthday in the middle of a Death Zone at all.\n\nSunny still had fun. Actually, he felt quite at home in the company of the quiet Song princess, not the least of all because she reminded him of Saint and Slayer — so, he secretly favored her above other Song sisters, despite the fact that the feline huntress did not seem even a little bit friendly.\n\nIt had been a good birthday, still..."

    "title": "2446 Lovers Spat.docx",
    "content": "2446 Lover's Spat\n\nIt had indeed been a good birthday.\n\nActually, Sunny had been a little dejected prior to the winter solstice… that was because Nephis had been giving him the cold shoulder after that heated conversation in the council chamber of the Jade Palace.\n\nHe found himself sleeping on the couch for the first time since they got together — well, in a metaphorical sense. In truth, neither of them had slept anywhere after that night, since both were terribly busy due to the approaching solstice. But he could still feel the flimsy walls of the proverbial doghouse around him.\n\nIt was not like Nephis was avoiding him or refusing to talk to him, or even behaving that differently — she had just retreated into her former aloof, impassive self. He could feel that she was angry… as well as that she was hurt beneath the anger.\n\nThey talked again after that night, trying to express their feelings and thoughts better. But that calmer discussion only managed to define where they stood better, not resolve the fundamental difference in their opinions. So, there was an awkward distance between them for a few days.\n\nSunny was saddenеd by that fact… but in a strange way, he was also happy.\n\nTo him, it seemed like a good sign.\n\nThis was the first fight they had gotten into аs a couple — usually, Sunny was too accommodating, and Nephis was too casual about most things. The fact that she was angry this time showed that she cared about him deeply enough to get angry, at least, which was not at all bad. In fact, it was reassuring.\n\nSunny would have been much more bitter if she had remained unperturbed and indifferent, instead.\n\nAs for how he himself felt…\n\nHe was tense and anxious. He knew Nephis, and he knew that she would throw herself into the jaws of the Forgotten God without hesitation in pursuit of her goal… of her unquenchable desire.\n\nSo, he was afraid to lose her.\n\nThat was why the two of them were angry at each other, and that was why they had spent several days apart.\n\nBut then, the solstice arrived. And despite how Nephis felt, she suppressed her stubborn nature and made an effort to make the day as pleasant as he could for Sunny.\n\nTheir conflict did not magically disappear after that, but the awkwardness dissipated somewhat.\n\n…And yet, even though things once again seemed normal, some distance still remained between them. That gap was narrow and seemingly insignificant, but Sunny had no idea how to breach it.\n\n'Damnation. Why are all my friends single? '\n\nHe desperately needed relationship advice, but there were few people he could ask for it — not that fighting ancient gods of Corruption was something many couples encountered as a stumbling block in their relationships.\n\nThere was Kim and Luster… but he would be mad to ask for advice from either Luster or the woman who had married Luster.\n\nWhich, basically, only left one candidate.\n\nEffie.\n\n'Yeah, no… I'd rather ask Nether for relationship advice.'\n\nAnd that guy was someone whose failed relationship destroyed the universe, no less.\n\nFinally finding a narrow and desolate alley, Sunny scratched the back of his head.\n\n'Come to think of it, how come almost all my friends are single?'\n\nThe answer was both obvious and sad… they were all workaholics.\n\nBut how was humanity going to survive if the cream of the crop of its adult population were not busy making hordes of kids?\n\nShaking his head and chastising his friends mentally, Sunny dove into the shadows, dragging his unbearably heavy baggage with him.\n\nApart from the solstice, his birthday, and his first quarrel with Nephis… well, his first quarrel with Nephis after they became a couple, at least… other things had happened, as well. The world kept spinning, not waiting for anyone.\n\nFar north, in the Burned Forest, an ocean of rats was currently besieging an endless legion of appalling millipedes, getting closer and closer to their nests. In the ruined cathedral of the Dark City, one of his incarnations was maniacally altering the design of his future shadowbound Memory to integrate his recent attainments in weaving into the theoretical spellweave.\n\nAnother abandoned the Forgotten Shore and was establishing a base in Ravenheart — his experience in Ariel's Game had proven that having almost all his avatars in the north was highly inconvenient during emergencies, so Sunny wanted to enhance his presence south of the Hollow Mountains.\n\nPlus, someone had to guard the Jade Board and the Dollhouse at all times… they had not figured out what to do with these time bombs yet, but keeping them in the Jade Palace was definitely not an option. Sunny had half the mind of tossing at least one of Ariel's creations into the seal containing the Dark Sea, but was not at all sure thаt it was a good idea.\n\nCassie, meanwhile, had taken a good look at Kai after the charming archer rested from his experiences in Ariel's Game.\n\nJust as Sunny had expected, the rings of ash empowering his friends had disappeared as soon as the game was over… however, they had not disаppeared without leaving a trace.\n\nKai had a new Attribute now, [Mark of Ash]. This Attribute granted him affinity to ash, whatever that meant — among other things, it increased his already immense resistance to fire, as well as granted him a minor, but scaling enhancement when near intense heat or surrounded by it.\n\nIt was nice to know that knowledge and experience… as well as an awesome custom-made bow and a quiver of masterwork enchanted arrows… were not the only things Kai had brought back with him from Ariel's Game. Still, Sunny was of the opinion that his friend deserved way more.\n\nAfter all, where else would one find a Saint who had slain a Cursed Beast?\n\nEmerging from the shadows on a quiet street, Sunny smiled and headed for a particular manor situated there.\n\nNow that the solstice was behind them… Sunny and Nephis were going to get even busier. He had the new project of enchanting human strongholds in the Dream Realm on his plate, which meant that he and Cassie would be busy with researching sorcery for the foreseeable future, while Nephis was needed on numerous battlefields.\n\nNow that the Cursed Demon was dead and she wasn't tethered to Bastion anymore, she would probably take the Ivory Island on a lengthy journey. The Death Zones south of Godgrave had remained an impregnable wall and a source of worry for them until now — Nephis wanted to conduct a proper reconnaissance of them first.\n\nBefore that, though, they had to receive a lengthy report from the agents of the Shadow Clan scattered across the two worlds. It had been put off because of the solstice, so now was the time. Aiko seemed to think that things were fishier than usual, as well… they needed to determine if she was correct with haste.\n\nBut that was for his other incarnations to worry about.\n\nThis one, meanwhile, had a different task.\n\nSunny was going to search for the fifth fragment of Weaver's lineage here in Bastion... in the true version of Bastion, to be precise."

    "content": "2447 Home Visit\n\nLeaving behind a few cracked cobblestones, Sunny arrived at a particular gate and waited for a while, expecting a giant wolf to come barreling out to engulf him in a hurricane of excitement, enthusiasm, and slobbery puppy love.\n\nHowever, nothing of the sort happened. Sunny had been preparing himself to act annoyed, but now, he was strangely disappointed.\n\n‘Ling Ling, that brat... does he not smell his favorite uncle standing at the door?’\n\nSunny waited a bit more, then sighed and raised his hand to knock at the gate. Before he could, however, it opened, revealing the sight of a toned, shapely, and sculpted torso. Sunny studied it for a few moments, then looked up... and then, with a sigh, a little higheг still.\nEffie was standing on the gravel road barefoot, wearing well-worn, comfy sweatpants and a makeshift crop top with a faded Night&Gale logo that heroically held back her ample figure. Her hair was disheveled, and she was rubbing her eyes while yawning.\n\nSeeing her in such a mundane set of clothes felt a little strange, considering who she was and where they were. But then again, Effie had never been one to care about her exalted status.\n\nLooking over Sunny's head, she gave the street a dubious lоok.\n\n“Huh? No one is here?\"\n\n‘Goddammit!’\n\nHe greeted his teeth.\n\n“Hey! Stop pretending that you can't see me.\"\n\nEffie raised her eyebrows and slowly lowered her gaze. Then, she lowered it some more and smiled brilliantly.\n“Oh! It's you, Shadow Boy. Sorry, didn't notice you there... and by there, I mean down, down there...\"\n\nSunny furrowed his brow in annoyance.\n\"How does it even make sense? Sure, let's say you didn't notice me. What about that huge bundle on my back? The one that is three meters long? Only a blind person would fail to notice that!\"\n\nEffie looked at the bundled item protruding high above his left shoulder, then scratched her head in embarrassment.\n\n“Well, fine. You got me there... anyway, come in. I was warned that you'd be showing up, so I've been waiting. This is officially my first day of vacation! | didn't even know that I get to have those, you know? Granted, since you are involved, it will probably be a work trip at best... now that I think about it, I think I was swindled out of taking a break...\"\n\nSunny followed Effie past the gate and looked around.\n\n“Huh? Where's Little Ling? And his dad? I was hoping to catch up\"\nShe gave him the side eye.\n\n“Ling Ling is punished and is helping his dad around the farm. Also... I find it weird that you are friends with my husband. Really weird!\"\n\nSunny blinked a few times, aghast and dismayed.\n\n“What? Why? Let me tell you, | am an awesome friend.’\n\nEffie nodded energetically.\n\n“Exactly. You are way too awesome! In the literal sense of the word, I mean. You are a Sovereign, for Spell's sake. What business does my husband have being pals with a Sovereign?\"\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n“That guy is married to a Saint and is raising another. I think he can handle being buddies with a Supreme. Don't sell that guy short... he is just that kind of impressive.’\n\nEffie glanced at him, then looked away with a soft smile.\n“Okay... that's true. He is indeed a little impressive, isn't he?\"\n\nBefore they entered the house, Sunny gestured for her to stop and took the bundled item off his back with an audible sigh of relief.\n\n\"Wait a bit. I'm not sure that we can take that thing inside.”\n\nThe grounds of Effie's manor had been treated to be able to support the titanic weight of her Transcendent form — as well as survive Little Ling's overabundant energy — but he wasn't sure about the house. Her husband had built it from the mystical wood from the woods around Bastion, but they were dealing with something truly special here.\n\nResting the bottom of the bundled item on the ground, Sunny supported its weight with one hand and used the other to massage his hurting shoulder.\n\n“Ah. That's better...\"\n\nEffie studied the narrow object with a curious expression.\nSunny grinned.\n\n“This... is a little gift from me to you.\"\n\nHe lowered it to the ground carefully and then knelt to remove the straps. Of course, both the cloth the item was wrapped in and the straps were made from manifested shadows, sо he could have simply dismissed them... but where was the theater in that?\nPlus, the more Sunny became akin to a deity, the more he learned to appreciate these small, human moments. Sure, he could teleport around and make the shadows do everything for him so that he never needed to lift a finger, but walking where he needed to go on his own two feet and doing what he wanted to do with his own pair of hands was its own small pleasure.\n\nAs he was unbundling the item, he gave Effie a mischievous smile.\n\n“It's nothing too crazy. I just thought of you when I saw it.’\nFrom within the cloth, an imposing spear was revealed. It was around three meters in length, devoid of frivolous adornments but beautiful in design. The great spear was both solemn and resplendent, seemingly forged from pure gold — despite that, it emanated a sense of indescribable fierceness and crushing gravity, inspiring awe and reverence in anyone who glimpsed it.\n\nThe spearhead was long, capable of both piercing and severing, while the shaft was flawlessly straight and seemingly indestructible. As soon as the spear was revealed, the air suddenly smelled of a lightning storm, and sparks of electricity arced across the grass.\n\nIt felt... ancient, unfathomably powerful, and holy. The world itself seemed to react to the presence of the golden weapon, becoming brighter and solemn around it.\n\nEffie looked at the great spear, enthralled.\n\"What...\"\nAt that moment, Sunny beamed.\n\n“A beanpоle for a beanpole!\"\n\nShe forced herself to look away from the spear and gave him an unamused look.\n“Wanna die?\"\n\nSunny laughed.\n\nEffie studied the spear some more, then asked in a tone of wonder:\n\n\"No, really. What is this beauty?\"\n\nSunny shook his head and finally dismissed the shadow cloth. His tone was nonchalant when he explained:\n\n\"This... is a divine relic."

And I mean that literally — it is a Divine Armament left behind by a slain god. I almost kicked the bucket to retrieve it, so be a darling and call me da... uncle, call me uncle.”\n\nEffie's eyes widened.\n\nIndeed, the great spear that looked like a bolt of obliterating lightning forged into a weapon was a Divine Weapon — it was the spear Sunny had glimpsed in one of the truths revealed to him in Ariel's Game. That truth had shown him Weaver challenging Ariel to a Death Game on a blood-soaked battlefield in a frozen hell... with Ariel inhabiting the body of a dying Divine. Sunny could remember every detail of that scene vividly...\nThe endless white plain, the broken corpses of lesser gods, the rivers of ichor flowing into the depths of the frozen ocean, the tendrils of nothingness seeping into reality through the cracks in the shattered sky... the giant kneeling in the middle of the silent battlefield, grasping his fractured head with two enormous hands as he mumbled disjointed words, full of terror.\n\nAnd a great spear laying on the broken ice, forgotten, still brimming with the echoes of annihilating lightning.\n\n...The giant might have forgotten about his spear before dying, his body swallowed by the imprisoned ocean, but Sunny had not. So, he ventured into frozen wastelands hoping to find it.\n\nLuckily, discovering the battlefield from his vision had not been too difficult — at least not for Sunny, who could cast his shadow sense across numerous kilometers and move with breathtaking speed. After all, there were not a lot of places where the sky was shattered and tendrils of nothingness seeped into reality, even in the Dream Realm.\nSurviving that harrowing place, however... that was an entirely different matter. Thousands of years had passed since the day he saw in the vision of truth, and the entire area had become far more eerie and terrifying, not to mention chillingly lethal, than it used to be.\n\nEverything was swallowed by the ice and bathed in the familiar white mist... only something seemed to be hiding in the mist there, making his skin crawl. The unbearable cold was almost absolute, far worse than even the Winter Beast's blizzard had been.\n\nSunny had wanted to explore the battlefield thoroughly, but in the end, he barely managed to retrieve the spear from deep within the ice before hastily making a retreat. The spear had been gigantic at first, but as soon as he touched it, it shrank to its current size.\n\nThat eerie place, that sense of terrible fear, that cold... was something he wished to never relive.\n\nLooking at Effie, Sunny smirked.\n“So, what do you say?\"\n\nEnthralled, Effie leaned forward and picked the spear.\n\n“Thanks, uncle-uahh!\"\n\nBarely lifting the spear off the ground, Effie toppled over and landed on her face, making Sunny laugh again.\n\n“Oh, sorry! I forgot to mention... it's quite heavy.”\n\nEffie herself was also a... top-heavy person. So, it was no wonder that she had lost balance and ended up falling down.\n\nLaying on the ground, she gave him a glare, then stood up and reached for the great spear once again. With a grunt, Effie lifted it after all. Lean muscles rolled under her dewy olive skin, and beads of sweat glistened on her face.\nSunny was not surprised to see her shouldering the crushing weight of the Divine weapon that made even a Sovereign struggle — if anyone had enough raw physical strength to carry the great spear, it was Effie. She studied it with a contemplative expression, then smiled.\n“Awesome. However... I don't think I am stгong enough to wield it in battle. No Saint is.\"\n\nSunny lingered for a few moments, then nodded.\n\n“Indeed, no Saint is. Which brings us to the next point of this conversation, and the real reason I'm here. Actually, I feel a bit awkward giving this speech for the second time, but here it goes... Nephis and I are going to appoint Apotheosis sooner or later, which means...\"\n\nEffie waved a hand in the air dismissively.\n“If you are about to tell me how someone else has to become Supreme before you guys jump into the Fifth Nightmare, no need. Actually, I already met Kai in NQSC, and he regaled me with the tale of your misadventures in the Death Game over some drinks. So, you can skip the explanation. I already know.”\n\nSunny stared at her for a few seconds.\n\"And?\"\n\nEffie placed the golden spear back on the ground and shrugged.\n\n\"Sure, I'm in.\"\n\nHe blinked a couple of times.\n\n“That, uh... you know that we are talking about you challenging the Fourth Nightmare, right? Not immediately, I mean — but eventually. That is the reason I took Kai to Ariel's Game, and that is why I want to take you to the Mirror Maze. To help you prepare.\"\n\nEffie yawned again, then let out a groan.\n“Damn it... all this talk of attaining Supremacy, and I haven't even had my morning coffee yet. I said sure, didn't I? Let's do it! Let's get me ready to challenge the Fourth Nightmare... eventually. Preferably after I had breakfast.\"\n\nSunny stared at her silently, then shook his head.\n\n\"Don't you need time to consider? Only four people in history have survived the Fоurth Nightmare, you know.”\n\nEffie met his gaze, then smiled faintly.\n“Look around.”\n\nSunny did, studying the cozy wooden home and the picturesque grounds of the manor.\nEffie, meanwhile, picked up the Divine spear and carefully leaned it against a nearby tree.\n\n“I have stuff to protect, Sunny.”\n\nIt was a very simple answer... but one that said it all.\nBrushing the dirt off her sweatpants and her stretched-out crop top, Effie started whistling a cheerful melody as she headed inside.\n\n“Don't dawdle! It's the full moon tonight, so let's grab something to eat and discuss what, exactly, we are going to do in the Mirror Maze. Oh, and also...\"\n\nShe turned around and smiled.\n\n“Thank you for the spear, really. I mean it.”\nThen, Effie's smile turned into a grin.\n\n“I mean, I did not know what to expect when you began boasting about the size of your bundle, but when you took that thing out... good heavens! It really...\"\n\nHeading into the house, Sunny pushed her inside.\n\n“Shut the hell up!\""

    "content": "2449 Dédales\n\nSunny climbed out of the water and rose to his feet, looking at the desolate, moonlit landscape of True Bastion.\n\nThe ruins of the great castle he and Cassie had explored once were completely gone, melted into a vast, eerily smooth plain of pale rock. Here and there, deep fractures marred its surface, harboring cold darkness. The rock itself was still radiating unbearable heat, making the waters of the lake seethe and boil—swimming to shore had not been a pleasant experience, to say the least. There used to be a dark, twisted forest on the other side of the lake; now, there was only cinders and ash, with towering bones protruding into the broken sky like charred pillars.\n\nA shattered moon was bathing the devastated land in silver light, reflecting from the restless surface of the dark water. The landscape felt eerie and alien, bearing little resemblance to the bustling city on the other side of the reflections. The fallen tower where Cassie used to wait for Sunny on their ventures into the Mirror Maze was gone. The walls of the castle were gone, as well—so were the ruins of the main keep that had served the King of Swords as a forge once.\n\nSunny suddenly was painfully aware of the inevitable, merciless passage of time.\n\nOf course, True Bastion had not been reshaped by time; instead, it had been reshaped by a passing demigod... the Star of Ruin.\n\nA demigod not unlike himself.\n\nThe pitiful remains of what had been a Demon's citadel once did not illustrate the eroding power of time; instead, they illustrated his own daunting power. Sunny was not that different from a force of nature now—in fact, by very definition, he was far more devastating than nature could ever be.\n\n'How odd...' He sighed deeply and turned into a shadow for a split second, leaving the water soaking his clothes and hair behind. A moment later, complеtely dry, Sunny assumed his human shape again.\n\n\"Darn, damn, dammit, damnation, what the actual hell?!\"\n\nHis quiet contemplation was unceremoniously destroyed by Effie, who chose that moment to rise from the boiling lake, glistening drops of water rolling down the graceful lines of the steel armour that clung to her body like a second layer of skin. The white cloth she wore around her hips and chest stuck to the smooth steel, doing nothing to obscure the stirring shape below.\n\nShe flipped her hair back, sending a scattering of droplets flying into the rays of silver moonlight, and looked around with a pout.\n\n\"..Kai gets to have awesome hot springs in Ravenheart, but I get to be cooked alive in a boiling lake? I almost became soup! How is that fair? Man... Nephis really did a number on this place.\"\nSunny sighed.\n\n“Yeah. The ruins are completely destroyed. It's strange, though... she mentioned that there would be no water in the lake, but it seems no different from before.\"\n\nEffie fanned herself, then gavе the vast expanse of fractured stone a peculiar look and shivered.\n\n“Actually, we destroyed most of the ruins with Morgan during the war. We dried out the lake, too—but water must be seeping through the reflections from the other side. It's a bit weird, no? Water flowing from an illusory lake into the real one. Can it even be called an illusion, then?\"\n\nSunny shrugged.\n\n“Well, it is an illusion created by the Demon of Imagination. Those can very well be more real than reality itself.\"\n\nHe gazed across the dark expanse of water, then peered into its depths.\n\n“There's a drowned city on the bottom of the real lake here, right? But there is nothing like that in our version of Bastion. That is also curious.\"\n\nEffie sighed, then began heading away from the shore.\n\n“You've been to Rivergate, I presume? Well, there is actually a twin complex of great dams north of True Bastion. This one was utterly destroyed thousands of years ago, though—my theory is that it was by the same blow that shattered the moon and turned Imagination’s castle into ruins. That was how the city drowned, I think.”\n\nSunny turned to look at her and raised an eyebrow.\n\n“There is another dam upstream from the Mirror Lake?\"\n\nEffie nodded.\n\n\"There is in True Bastion, but not in the illusory one. I think both dams were built by the Demon Imagination, and that they had something to do with the Mirror Lake. She seems to have been fond of playing with water, for some reason. It's such an ancient past that there is no way to know for sure, of course.”\n\nSunny’s second eyebrow rose, as well.\n\n“Huh? Since when are you interested in exploring ancient history?\"\n\nEffie chuckled.\n\n“Since I was put in charge of Bastion? I need to know the background of the city I am meant to rule to avoid unpleasant surprises. Ancient past tends to become present problems quite often here in the Dream Realm.\"\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n“I couldn't have put it better myself.\"\n\nHe lingered for a moment, then looked up at the shattered moon and asked:\n\n“Have you ever reached the boundary of this reflection?\"\n\nEffie shook her head.\n\n“No, because when we fought here, Morgan had drawn True Bastion into reality to protect the illusory version—it just bordered the surrounding regions of the Dream Realm seamlessly, as if it had always been there. But I imagine that there's just nothing at the edges... something like the boundary of the Beast Farm.”\n\nBy then, they reached the deepest of the fractures that broke the surface of the mountain—the dark fissure led all the way to the Mirror Maze.\n\nThe piece of mirror Nephis had discarded was still laying on its edge, covered in soot. Sunny picked it up, studied it for a moment, then crushed it in his fist.\n\nOpening the fist to let the wind scatter the fine glass dust, he pointed to the fracture.\n“Are you going first, or should I?\"\n\nEffie suddenly smiled.\n\n\"Oh my! It's not every day that a man invites me to explore a deep cr...\"\n\nSunny smiled too, then raised a hand and calmly pushed her over the edge."

    "content": "2450 Kingdom of Imagination\nA little fall was not going to hurt a Saint, and it was especially not going to hurt Effie, whose Awakened Ability made her body as tough as steel. Granted, this particular fall was quite a lengthy one... but in the end, both of them reached the Mirror Maze unscathed, if a little worse for wear and covered in dust.\n\n“Crap... I can't see anything. What a hassle,\" Effie complained, but she did not summon a luminous Memory. That was because Sunny had drowned the Mirror Maze in shadows on purpose — this was his tried and trusted method of erasing the infinite reflections from its walls, thus avoiding encountering the Others.\n\n\"I suspect that the intended — and therefore the safest — way to explore the heart of this maze is to traverse it across reflections. But since neither of us knows how to deal with the Others, we will just walk like normal people.\" He turned to Effie.\n\n“Grab my hand.\"\n\nHe offered her his hand, but she did not take it. Sunny frowned.\n\n“What seems to be the problem? What, are you shy all of a sudden?\"\n\nEffie rolled her eyes.\n\n\"No, you numskull. I can't see where your hand is!\"\n\nLetting out an awkward cough, Sunny grabbed her by the forearm and pulled her into the darkness.\n\nThe Mirror Maze seemed no different from how it had been before, not damaged by the dreadful devastation above at all. Granted, there was more dust on the floor — but other than that, it was in pristine condition. As they walked through the darkness, Effie seemed to be listening to the sounds of their footsteps intently. Eventually, she asked:\n\n“So, Clan Valor had no idea this place was here?\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"No. It used to be hidden deep underground and protected from usual forms of detection. I barely found it myself... so, neither Warden nor his son knew about the existence of the Mirror Maze, despite spending decades right above it.\"\n\nEffie remained silent for a bit, then said suddenly:\n\n“But Mordret must have known.\"\n\nSunny gave her a guarded look.\n\nYes... that was the conclusion he had drawn, as well. Mordret could gaze through the mirrors around him and even travel through them — those were his Dormant and Awakened Abilities. So, when young Mordret first returned into the cold embrace of Clan Valor, he would have definitely felt the presence of a vast mass of mirrors beneath True Bastion.\n\nHe must have known that the Mirror Maze was here... maybe he had even been the first human to explore it. Was he hiding somewhere in the complicated web of twisting tunnels right now?\n\nSunny did not think so... he did not think that Mordret was in any of the tunnels, that was.\n\n“If he's here, he is probably in the Hall of Imagination. That is where we are heading, as well.\"\n\nEffie tensed a little.\n\n“Remind me why we are going there, again?\"\n\nSunny collected his thoughts before speaking.\n\n“Well... you are the master of Bastion, so you know better than anyone what the Great Mirror is. It is situated deep below the castle — its illusory version, that is — in a great underground hall hidden in the heart of the mountain. It is also the nexus of the Component of your Citadel, the one that allows the true and false versions of Bastion to swap places. One stays in reality, while the other one is safely contained within the Great Mirror.\"\n\nEffie pursed her lips.\n\n\"And it also allows the Others to crawl into reality from True Bastion if someone forgets to cover it.\"\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n“But actually, I think that we have not even discovered the true Component of Bastion yet.\"\n\nEffie tilted her head a little.\n\n“Huh?\"\n\nSunny considered his words for a moment. “Think about it. There is an underground chamber with the Great Mirror below the illusory castle, connected to it by secret passages. But what about True Bastion? There are no passages. Instead, there is the Mirгor Maze... and the underground chamber at its heart. The Hall of Imagination, which makes things you imagine real — or at least creates illusions of those things that are seemingly nо different from real.’\n\nHe paused for a moment, then added in a somber tone:\n\n“I did not dare to explore the Hall of Imagination before, so I don't know what is hidden in its center. But if theory is correct... then there is another Great Mirror there — the true Great Mirror, not an illusion of it that stands below the False Bastion.”\n\nEffie frowned in the darkness, just as stunned as the first time he had shared this theory with her.\n\nThis time, however, she had a question.\n\n“The Great Mirror... the supposedly illusory Great Mirror leads to True Bastion. Then, where does the true Great Mirror lead?\"\n\nSunny smiled faintly.\n\n“That is what we are going to find out.’\n\nAt that moment, he stopped and looked down, a troubled expression appearing on his face.\n\nEffie almost slammed into him, stopping in time only because she had been listening to the sounds of his steps the whole time.\n\n“What is it?\"\n\nSunny knelt and studied the floor.\n\n“There are footprints in the dust.\"\n\nHe expected to find some sign that Mordret had passed through these tunnels. However, what Sunny had not expected... was that there would be two sets of footprints, one slightly more faded than the other.\n\nAnd a bit smaller, too.\n\nHe remained silent for a while, then said in a surprised tone:\n\n“I think... that both Mordret and Morgan were here before us.\"\n\nThe former princess of Valor had vanished without a trace a few months after the war. Some were convinced that her brother had killed her, after all, while some simply assumed that she had left to start a new life somewhere, in complete anonymity — after all, being the last heir of a fallen, infamous Great Clan was not the easiest fate.\n\nSome, meanwhile, believed that Morgan had challenged the Fourth Nightmare.\n\nAs it turned out, though, she was here, in the Mirror Maze, instead.\n\nSunny did not know quite what to make of it, let alone how to feel about it.\n\n“How curious.\"\n\nHe was glad that Morgan was still alive, though.\n\nSunny remained motionless for a few moments, then rose to his feet and continued moving forward while guiding Effie through the darkness.\n\n“Come. We must hurry to the Hall of Imagination.\"\n\nAfter a while, she said:\n\n“Wait a minute...\"\n\nEffie grabbed his forearm as well, slowly increasing pressure.\n\n“Was that why you did not let me eat the whole day? So that I could not think about anything except food by the time we reach that damn hall?!\"\n\nSunny smiled sheepishly in the darkness.\n\n“Oh, that... well, yes. I think it's going to work out great!\"\n\nAs for Sunny himself, he had a far simpler way of getting to the heart of the Hall of Imagination without summoning the illusion of some Unholy Titan into existence.\n\nHe was going to release control of his incarnation and let his shadow enter in his stead, then retake control at the last moment.\n\nHis shadows did, indeed, have minds of their own — but he was pretty sure that the Hall of Imagination had not been designed to make the fantasies of shadows come true. Even if it did, whatever they could imagine was not going to be nearly as harrowing as what Sunny could.\n\nEspecially this shadow... the naughty shadow. Its fantasies were pretty transparent, most of the time...\n\nThere was only one way to find out for sure, though.\n\nEffie was earnestly trying to crush his forearm in a vice grip, but Sunny simply ignored her — now that he had both the Bone Weave and the Flesh Weave, not to mention the Jade Shell, enduring such pressure was not a big problem.\n\nIt still hurt like hell, though!\n\nEffie growled in the darkness:\n\n“Hey, Shadow Boy! If you don't feed me right this moment, I'll eat you... instead?\"\n\nHer voice grew quieter and then fell silent, because at that moment, they reached the boundary of the Hall of Imagination.\n\nThe walls of the tunnels spread out, opening into a vast open space. It was full of darkness, and neither Sunny's sight nor his shadow sense could penetrate it.\n\nThey froze for a while, preparing themselves for the trial of the Hall of Imagination warily.\n\nIn the end, he sighed and pulled Effie forward.\n\n\"Let's go. The sooner we do... the sooner we can get into some kind of insane trouble, barely survive it, and return victorious with scary stories to tell.\"\n\nEffie blinked a couple of times.\n\n“What? Was that supposed to calm me?\"\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n“Yes. You might not know it, but I have a proven track record of doing just that. I'm still alive, aren't I?\"\n\nEffie's mouth hung open.\n\n\"No, you're not! You are literally dead! Two entire armies saw you kill yourself, and then get killed by Nephis immediately after that!\"\n\nSunny grinned.\n\n“What, was I supposed to die from just that?\"\n\nWith that, he took a step forward.\n\nThey had already discussed the plan earlier, so there was not much left to say. Sunny positioned himself in the middle of the entrance to the Hall of Imagination, then concentrated and summoned Saint — having at least one Shadow covering for them was probably a wise move, and she was the best choice for this particular trial. The taciturn knight emerged from the darkness and glanced at him with her usual indifference.\n\nThis time, howeveг, Saint's gaze lingered on him for a while longer, as if sensing remnant traces of the Jade Titan persona he had assumed in the Death Game.\n\nEventually, Saint took her place to his left, while Effie stood to his right.\n\n“Ah. I don't like it...\"\n\nShe raised a hand to grab his shoulder, Sunny got ready to temporarily release control of his incarnation, knowing that Effie and Saint would get him to where he needed to be.\n\n“Just think about your favorite food. Actually, I've tried something very delicious recently! Have you ever tried... a barbequed Cursed rat? If not, I cannot recommend roasting one over lava enough...\"\n\nEffie sighed deeply, then mumbled a quiet curse and pushed him.\n\nTogether, the three of them entered the Hall of Imagination.\n\nSunny did not remember quite what happened next.\n\nNext thing he knew, he was someplace else... He was someone else."

    "content": "2451 Mirage City Noir\n\nSunny dreamed a nightmare.\n\nIn that nightmare, he lived in a dying world where grotesque monsters were real, people possessed supernatural abilities, and humanity was on the verge of being snuffed out by the encroaching darkness. The world was one vast battlefield, and every day, countless lives were lost in the bloody battle for survival.\n\nSunny himself was one of the strongest people in that world, having clawed his way to the pinnacle of power through mud, blood, heartbreak, and thorns of betrayal. He was buckling under the crushing weight of responsibility and carrying the cruel burden of his own past sins.\n\n…He also had a smoking hot, stunning, drop-dead gorgeous girlfriend.\n\nSunny could somewhat accept the existence of monsters and superpowers, but that last detail had really clued him in to the fact that it was all a dream.\n\n'Ah…'\n\nHe was woken up by the blaring sounds of the alarm.\n\n\"Wake up, Sunny! Wake up, Sunny! Wake up, Sunny!\"\n\n'Shit.'\n\nGrabbing his phone, he fumbled to turn the alarm off and then sat up, looking around with groggy, bloodshot eyes.\n\nHis room was dark and messy, full of stale air and empty bottles. The TV was on, showing a colorful commercial for Valor Group's new extravagant mall. The young CEO was cutting the red ribbon in front of a cheering crowd, his simple smile blinding the camera…\n\nSunny stared at the TV for a while, deep darkness nestling in his eyes, then tossed his phone at it. The screen shattered, and a net of cracks distorted the smiling face on it, making it seem as if he was staring at a broken mirror.\n\nSunny was suddenly wide awake.\n\n\"Ah, no! Shit!\"\n\nHe jumped off the bed, sending several empty bottles rolling across the floor, and hurried to the TV. The screen of his phone was cracked, as well, but luckily, it was still in working condition. Sunny checked the time and the date, then let out a relieved sigh and slowly stood up.\n\nStill reeling from the damn nightmare, Sunny muttered a few curses and walked to the window. Opening the shutters, he grimaced from the light and looked outside.\n\nThe dim lilac radiance of the early dawn washed over his pale body — his toned muscles, a scattering of scars decorating it like badges of dishonor, and a frightening tattoo of a black serpent coiling around his arms and torso.\n\n...Not exactly what one would expect from a decorated police officer, but Sunny had lived a tumultuous life before finding the straight path.\n\nOutside the window, the city was obscured by a curtain of rain. Cars were rushing to outrun the morning traffic, leaving trails of scarlet glow in their wake. Here and there, red neon crosses stood out against the twilight sky like beacons for lost souls, and all around them, countless shops and restaurants were opening their doors like temples to greed and gluttony.\n\nAbove it all, glass skyscrapers stood like towering cathedrals. There, in the bowels of conglomerate offices, dwelled the real power.\n\nThe streets were grimy, the apartment buildings were decrepit, and the people were worn down, confined to the narrow pavements by the traffic while walking to their destinations with glassy eyes.\n\nSomething about it all seemed strangely off, as if the world of his nightmares was much more real.\n\n'...There aгe no barriers surrounding the city.'\n\nIt was such a strange thought, and yet, Sunny could not get rid of the feeling that there were supposed to be enormous air filtration barriers on the horizon.\n\nBut what for?\n\n'I must have really lost it.'\n\nIn any case, the sun was rising above Mirage City.\n\nIt was time to face a new day...\n\nToday, Sunny made a reluctant effort to look presentable. He took a shower, shaved, and found the least wrinkled clothes he had. Black jeans, a gray t-shirt, and an inconspicuous jacket… the clothes hid his sharp edge, but thеre must have still been something in his gaze, because a drunk loitering at the back of the building reeled back from just one glance.\n\nSunny watched him stagger away with a cold, somber expression. The man seemed like a genuine drunk, but one never knew… it paid to be careful.\n\nOnce the swaying figure disappeared around the corner, Sunny climbed into his old, battered car and put the key into the ignition.\n\nAs he drove along the city streets, he could not help but think of the dark, desolate coastal highway of the Antarctic Center. No… that had happened in another nightmare. This was reality, so why was he thinking about such dreadful things?\n\nThe radio was playing a catchy tune, reminding him that, apart from having a smoking hot girlfriend, he was also friends with a genuine pop star in those dreams. On top of that, he owned a thriving business, lived in a castle, was watching over a lovable little sister, and… played the flute?\n\n'What the actual hell...'\n\nDreams were truly a bizarre place.\n\nSunny was not really a person with a rich imagination, though. How did his subconscious even imagine all these things?\n\nShaking his head, he stopped at a traffic light and struggled against the paranoid feeling that every driver on the road was staring at him.\n\nSome time later, Sunny reached his destination... it was a prestigious psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of the city.\n\nLocking his car, he walked across a small park to the entrance and showed his pass to the security guard. Many affluent people received treatment in this seemingly idyllic hospital, so security was really tight here — the stunning building was no different from a fortress, really, and there were many places inside where regular people like himself weren't allowed.\n\nAs for Sunny himself, he was not an affluent person. However, he was a civil servant in a situation that put the higher-ups in an awkward position, so they sent him here for mandatory psychiatric counseling.\n\nThat had been months ago. And today… today, gods willing, was going to be his last session. If everything went well, he was going to be reinstated and return to work. And just in time — Sunny had a feeling that the bastard he had been pursuing for so long was going to strike again, soon.\n\nAs Sunny was let inside, he caught himself on having used the word \"gods\" — plural — and frowned.\n\n'Get a grip, damn it.'\n\nHe could not mess up today.\n\nSoon, he found himself sitting in a comfortable chair and facing his therapist.\n\nHis therapist was some kind of big deal in the shrink world despite being relаtively young. She was quiet and extremely professional, so despite the mandatory nature of their relationship, Sunny did not dislike her a lot. The woman just sort of sat there silently while he talked about whatever was on his mind most of the time, so there was little to dislike.\n\nWell… there was one thing.\n\nHis therapist really had no business being so goddamn beautiful. It was surreal, really, how breathtaking she was — not to mention distracting.\n\nHer skin was pure white alabaster, her eyes were like two onyx gems, and her features were almost inhumanly flawless. It was as though she had not been born, but actually cut from stone by a mad sculptor. As a result, what should have been beautiful looked a bit eerie, instead... haunting, even.\n\nHer usual lack of emotion only made the overall impression more disturbing.\n\nMeeting her indifferent gaze, Sunny forced out a smile.\n\n\"Good morning, doc.\"\n\nShe looked аt him evenly…\n\nAnd then smiled softly.\n\nThe smile transformed her face, making it utterly tantalizing, almost painful to look at. It was like looking at something holy... a living saint, maybe.\n\n\"Good morning, Detective. Would you like a coffee?\"\n\nFor some reason, Sunny felt a sense of profound wrongness when he heard the hauntingly beautiful therapist talk.\n\nAlso, for some reason, he felt compelled to answer her question honestly.\n\nSunny shrugged.\n\n\"Sure. Why not?\"\n\n...Like every other calamity in his life, this catastrophe started with the smile of a beautiful woman and a cup of coffee."

    "title": "2452 Red Pool.docx",
    "content": "2452 Red Pool\n\nThe coffee tasted heavenly. It was strange, really… Sunny had been suffering from insomnia for a while now, surviving on sleeping pills and still having nightmares every time he did fall asleep. Perhaps as a result, everything felt tasteless to him — but whenever his therapist offered him coffee, he could not help but enjoy it.\n\n\"So, where do I start?\"\n\nAs she opened her notebook to silently take notes, Sunny sighed.\n\n\"I don't get those recurrent nightmares often, anymore…\"\n\nHe still saw them every time he slept, but he rarely slept, so that could hardly be called \"often\".\n\n\"The world is sort of annoying, but I don't get irrationally angry either. It feels like I have a firmer grasp on myself.\"\n\nHe had smashed his TV just this morning, but that anger was perfectly reasonable. There were many good reasons to hate the Valor Group and its CEO.\n\n\"...I don't thinκ I really felt paranoid about something since our last session. So, I guess that is an improvement?\"\n\nHe had considered the best way to kill the supposed drunk in case the man attacked him, earlier this morning, but that was not paranoia. That was just experience, and Sunny would be a fool not to pay attention to strangers around him.\n\nSunny continued spouting confident half-truths to give the therapist the impression that he was a stable, well-functioning member of society. Someone whom she should give a clean bill of health and never see again. He wasn't sure if his act was fooling the taciturn beauty, but she did not question his account even once.\n\nHe was not sure if she believed him or simply didn't care.\n\nAfter a while, Sunny found himself simply recounting his thoughts to her without much pretense.\n\n\"I am bored. I am restless… I want to get back to work. I tried doing things that normal people do in their free time, like going on a picnic or taking a walk in the park. But it has been raining the whole damn month. Staying inside is infuriating because of all the bullshit on the news, and I can't really go to a bar, can I? You told me not to mix sleeping pills with alcohol. I feel like... I'm missing something that I never had. So…\"\n\nHe hesitated for a few moments, and then asked:\n\n\"Can't you just pass me, doc? We both know that I am only here to comply with what the judge said. And the judge only sent me here to comply with people paying for his vacation home.\"\n\nOf course, Sunny had failed to disclose a few important facts about himself to his beautiful shrink.\n\nFor example, the fact that he sometimes felt like his nightmares were the actual reality.\n\nOr that he sometimes believed himself to be the only real person in the world.\n\nOr that he sometimes hallucinated foreign sights, sounds, and sensations, as if he possessed multiple bodies. That was probably because he often spaced out for a few seconds because of the insomnia, falling into bouts of microsleep.\n\nLittle stuff like that.\n\nThe therapist looked at him with her usual aloof expression.\n\n\"Do you think you are mentally fit to resume work, Detective?\"\n\nSunny laughed, hiding the literal shivers her sonorous, enthralling voice sent running down his spine. It was probably a good thing that his therapist did not speak a lot… her voice was just as perilous as her looks, if not more bewitching.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Me, mentally fit? God, no. But who the hell is, anyway? I mean… with the way the world is, wouldn't it be stranger if I was perfectly fine? I'd definitely turn around and run if I ever met a person who seemed happy, healthy, and completely sane.\"\n\nShe studied him for a while, then nodded and closed her notebook.\n\n\"Alright, Detective. To be honest, I am not a fan of mandatory counseling myself. Despite the circumstances, however, you did show considerable progress in these few months we have been seeing each other. So, I am ready to report that you are fit to resume service… on one condition.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow, surprised. This was probably the most he had heard her talk ever since they met.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nThe therapist studied him for a while, then said in her usual aloof tone:\n\n\"I want you to continue therapy even after you are reinstated… in fact, I insist that you do. You are my patient, and I dislike the idea of leaving things unfinished. I abhor it.\"\n\nSunny chuckled.\n\n\"So… either I continue to see you, or I can't go back to work? How is that different from mandatory counseling?\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"You can refuse.\"\n\nHe remained silent for a few moments, then scoffed.\n\n\"I am sorry, doc, but you seem to be overlooking something. These sessions were being billed to the Mirage City Police Department. If we continue to see each other after my mandatory therapy is over, though, I'll have to pay for the sessions myself. And I am very sorry to say this… but you are way out of my price range.\"\n\nA peasant like him would not even be let near this exclusive hospital in normal circumstances, let alone receive treatment here.\n\nHis therapist gave him an impassive look, then sighed and reached into her pocket. Producing a beautifully embossed business card, she offered it to him with a graceful gesture.\n\n\"This is my personal number. We can work something out.\"\n\nSunny received the card with a stunned expression and looked down at it.\n\n'...Saint? No way, that's her actual name?'\n\nThe saintly therapist was actually called Saint. Learning that fact, Sunny really felt crazy for a moment.\n\nPlus, she was giving him her number…\n\nPushing silly thoughts out of his head, Sunny looked at the aloof beauty and cleared his throat.\n\n\"Well, alright. I'll call you when things settle down a little, doc.\"\n\nWith that, he put her card into his wallet and stood up.\n\n\"Thanks for everything… I guess.\"\n\nShe nodded indifferently, already turning away to start filling out the necessary paperwork.\n\n\"Don't forget to get your sleeping pills from the pharmacy. Good sleep is the foundation of mental health, Detective. Be well.\"\n\nA few seconds later, Sunny found himself outside her office, somewhat lost. He had not expected that getting the stone-faced shrink to give him the clean bill of health would be so easy.\n\n'It turned out great, though?'\n\nShaking his head, he went to the pharmacy situated on the lower floor of the hospital to get his prescription.\n\n…It was when he was waiting for the pharmacist to fill it, listening to the rain pattering against the window, that there was a loud sound of something heavy falling nearby.\n\nThen, a piercing scream shattered the silence.\n\nAs Sunny turned around, he saw several tall, muscular orderlies running to the source of the noise with troubled faces.\n\n\"Hurry!\"\n\n\"She got out again!\"\n\n\"How the hell is she…\"\n\nHe lingered for a while, watching the disappear behind a heavy door, then separated himself from the wall he had been leaning on and followed.\n\nBehind the door was one of the areas of the hospital where casual visitors weren't allowed. The dimly lit corridor was a complete mess, with several people struggling to get someone whom Sunny could not see behind them to the floor.\n\nJust in front of him, he saw an overturned wheelchair, its wheel still spinning…\n\nAnd a pool of red, vivid, glistening blood slowly spreading across the floor.\n\nAt the heart of the pool was a kneeling nurse who was crying loudly while clutching at her face, red streaks running between her fingers and painting her white uniform into a striking shade of vermilion.\n\nAt that moment, one of the brawny orderlies was tossed back, colliding with the wall with enough force to make the floor shake.\n\n\"D—damn it! How is she… so strong!\"\n\n\"Hold her down, shit!\"\n\n\"Don't hurt her, you idiots! We're all done for if she gets hurt!\"\n\nSunny could finally see the cause of the mayhem.\n\nThe person whom four muscular orderlies had been struggling to contain… was a slender woman with wavy black hair and a pretty, but cold and sharp face. She was wearing a shredded straitjacket and resisting the orderlies with an amount of strength unexpected from someone of her build and constitution, clearly unhinged.\n\nStrangest of all, though…\n\nWas the fact that her eyes were of bright, vibrant red color.\n\nJust like the blood on the floor.\n\nHumans were not supposed to have vividly red eyes, but no one seemed to notice or pay it any attention.\n\nBy then, the orderlies finally managed to push the woman to the ground and were in the process of tying the sleeves of her straitjacket back up. She had been resisting them, still… until her gaze fell on Sunny.\n\nHe froze.\n\n'Why… why does she look so familiar?'\n\nThe woman's eerie red eyes widened a little when she saw him.\n\nAnd then, she suddenly laughed.\n\nHer laughter resounded across the corridor, growing louder and louder until it drowned out the pitiful whimpers of the injured nurse.\n\nThe insane woman seemed to be incredibly amused all of a sudden. She seemed to be having thе time of her life.\n\nTaking a step back, Sunny pursed his lips and turned around.\n\n'Just another psycho.'\n\nThere were too many of those around, these days.\n\nAs he was walking back to the door, however, her laughing voice washed over him:\n\n\"Kill him! You can actually kill him here! Find… Athena!\"\n\nShaking his head, Sunny shut the door behind him and tried to calm his wildly beating heart.\n\nThe stench of blood was still stuck in his nose, making his hands tremble.\n\nThe sight of it…\n\n'Damn it.'\n\nAlthough Sunny knew that mixing sleeping pills with alcohol was a terrible idea, he suddenly really craved a drink."

    "content": "2453 Ex Nihilo\n\nWhen Sunny left the psychiatric hospital, the world was still being pelted by rain. The sky was discharging a seemingly endless deluge оf water, as if wishing to drown the city below.\n\nThe gutters were overflowing, and the pedestrians were clinging to the sides of the streets, afraid to be given a cold shower by the cars that rushed by.\n\nLooking up, Sunny closed his eyes and offered his face to the rain, feeling the flowing water washing away the scent of blood from his nostrils.\n\n'At least the city will be cleaner because of the rain.'\n\nBut then, there would be heat and humidity. The heat nevеr reached the roots of the city, though — there, in the damp darkness, everything that the water had washed away would begin to rot. The rot would give birth to vast swarms of vermin…\n\nStanding there with his eyes closed, Sunny smiled.\n\n'Swarms of vermin, huh.'\n\nAs if this city had not already been infested by the worst kind of vermin of them all.\n\nPeople.\n\nHuman vermin thrived in dark places, too, and just like trash, they were thoroughly rotten away from the light.\n\nShaking his head, he walked to his car across the puddles. As he did, the image of the laughing woman with vermilion eyes surfaced in his mind. Why did he feel like he had seen her somewhere?\n\nConsidering the usual clientele of the hospital, she had to be a scion of a wealthy family. Sunny rarely brushed sides with people like that, so he struggled to imagine where they would have met… unless, of course, he had seen her in a nightmare.\n\nA person with vibrant red eyes was exactly like something he would dream of. But how would a woman he had never met end up in his dreams?\n\n'I wonder whom she wanted me to kill.'\n\nSunny sighed.\n\nWealthy people usually ended up in an asylum for two reasons — either their family wanted to get rid оf them, or they were junkies. Considering the woman's age and unhinged behavior, the latter was more likely. Granted, she could have been drugged up as a result of being put in a psychiatric hospital, not the other way around… but that was none of his business.\n\n'Find Athena?'\n\nWasn't Athena some kind of pagan goddess? Where would he even find someone like that?\n\n'Come on. You are not seriously thinking about what some crazy lunatic said, are you?'\n\nSunny pursed his lips as he climbed into his car.\n\nHe was pretty sure that he was hallucinating again — that was probably the reason the woman's eyes seemed vividly red. Insomnia and sleeping pills made it hard for him to differentiate dreams from reality sometimes, and the sight of blood was an old trigger.\n\nSo, did he really have ground to stand on when calling someone a lunatic?\n\nAs he was turning the key in the ignition, his phone rang. Glancing at the cracked and shattered screen, he smiled darkly and took the call.\n\n\"Yes. Yeah… what, did he expect to get rid of me so easily? Sorry to disappoint, then. I'll be thеre today.\"\n\nThen, he paused for a moment, his tone changing subtly.\n\n\"So, there's a new body… my, my, my. It is as if someone wanted to welcome me back.\"\n\nEnding the call and throwing the phone on the seat, he looked forward with a grim expression.\n\n\"...Wait just a little bit more, bastard. I'll find you.\"\n\nThe car growled quietly and sped away, wading through the rain.\n\n***\n\n\"You must have really lost your mind, Detective. No, you really are crazy. How the hell did you pass the psych evaluation? Hey, you little shit. Look at me. Am I a joke to you?\"\n\nSunny, who was sitting in the office of the Homicide Division's Captain, looked at the grizzled old man in front of him and smiled.\n\n\"A bit, yes.\"\n\nThe man stared at him in shock.\n\n\"What did you just say? Hey, Sunny… I could have put your crazy ass in prison for the stunt you pulled off back then. You know that, right? Bastard, you are only sitting here right now because of my respect for the former captain, who held you in high regard. What did she see in you, I have no idea, but I am in charge now. So, you are going to treat me with respect. Do you understand?\"\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n\"I said that you are, indeed, a bit of a joke to me. I don't know that you could have put me in prison. And yes, I understand.\"\n\nHe regarded the new captain somberly.\n\nThe man was a veteran of the Mirage City Police… but he had been put in charge of the Homicide Division recently, and it was not for a stellar track record or capability. It was because the new captain was a man who knew his place and was trusted to make life easier for the higher-ups.\n\nIn other words, he knew how to look the other way when needed. The man was not always corrupt, but he could be when orders to be corrupt came from above.\n\nBack then, Sunny had indeed made a mess that could have landed him in prison. However, that case was an extremely public one, and getting rid of him would have spelled a political nightmare. So, this aging man was put in the freshly empty seat of the captain and told to make the noise go away quietly. So even if he had wanted to get rid of Sunny permanently, he couldn't have.\n\nSunny did not care one way or the other, though.\n\n\"Well, anyway, I'll say it again. The body that was discovered by the river this morning? Put me in charge of that case, please… sir.\"\n\nThe old man ground his teeth.\n\n\"Why the hell would I give that case to you, of all people?! Are you positively insane, you little fiend?!\"\n\nSunny stared at him for a few moments, making the Captain shiver slightly, then grinned.\n\n\"I am not insane. I have a paper to prove that I'm not, in fact. As to why you'll put me on that case — you know the answer as well as I do… sir. It's because, unlike the rest of your more compliant subordinates, I will actually solve it. You must be being pressured real bad to catch the bastard by now, aren't you? Once the press catches wind that there's a seventh victim, that pressure will only grow.\"\n\nThe captain looked at him somberly.\n\nMirage City was a diseased place at the best of times, but lately, it had been plagued by a new, vile malady...\n\nThat malady was a demented, but insidious serial killer who left mutilated bodies in his wake while avoiding capture like a ghost.\n\nThe Nihilist."

    "title": "2454 Lone Wolf.docx",
    "content": "2454 Lone Wolf\n\nThe Nihilist… was the stupid name the journalists had given the unhinged predator who stalked the dark alleys of Mirage City.\n\nThe killings seemed random, but were too flawlessly executed to be anything except meticulously planned. The murderer did not discriminate in choosing victims, either, so the whole city was on edge.\n\nThe incident that had led to Sunny being sent to mandatory counseling, as well as to the new captain's sudden promotion, were connected to the Nihilist, as well.\n\n'Shit. Even I am starting to call him by that idiotic name.'\n\nNot only did Sunny hate the idea of giving a sick, cowardly loser a name as pompous as that, but it was also somewhat of a personal sleight to him. The killer left absolutely no traces behind and chose his victims through a seemingly meaningless process, so the newspapers had invented an ominous moniker — the Nihilist — to draw more attention to the story and sell more copies.\n\nEvery time a new victim was found, their advertising revenue exploded. Politicians, meanwhile, gave impassioned speeches to build populist platforms while simultaneously introducing invasive laws under the false pretense of ensuring public safety to tighten their control over people. Many ghouls were reaping benefits from the gruesome deaths of the serial killer's victims…\n\nBut enough was enough.\n\nThe same politicians who had used the public panic to score points would start to look like fools if the Nihilist wasn't caught soon. The press could not keep selling the same story over and over again without losing the public's interest. And people in law enforcement who had climbed the career ladder with promises of swift results were growing more and more desperate to produce them.\n\nSo, no matter how much the new captain disliked and was threatened by Sunny, he could not do anything about it.\n\nBecause Sunny was indeed the best detective in the division, by far. He had come up through the ranks fair and square, first as a beat cop, then as a detective in the Organized Crime Division… naturally, he made more than a few enemies in the deeply corrupt and rottеn Mirage City Police as a result.\n\nThe fact that he had never been demoted or dismissed was the best proof of how good he was at his job. Although his methods were often messy, Sunny always brought results.\n\nThe new captain glared at him silently, seething with fury. But Sunny did not care — he was going to catch the Nihilist, and a mere sicophant was not going to stop him. \"So… can I go take a look at the crime scene before rain washes everything away? Sir.\"\n\nThe old man ground his teeth, then cursed loudly.\n\n\"Fine! I'll give you the case, damn it! Be warned, though — if you fail to bring that sick bastard in, it will be your head flying. I'll feed you to the newspapers and make you a proper scapegoat. Don't say I didn't warn you!\"\n\nSunny shrugged with a derisive smile.\n\n\"What else is new? I'll get going then.\"\n\nThe captain leaned forward.\n\n\"Not so fast, asshole. I said that I'll give you the case, but I didn't say that there would not be strings attached. In fact, I have a condition.\"\n\nSunny let out a long sigh.\n\n\"Why does everyone want to give me conditions today? Captain… you're not going to slip me your number too, are you?\"\n\nThe old man scoffed.\n\n\"What the hell are you even… actually, never mind. You can have the case, but I'll be assigning you a partner. Someone has to watch your back, anyway — lest the recent incident repeat itself.\"\n\nSunny frowned deeply, then said with a hint of barely contained anger in his voice:\n\n\"Like hell you will. You know I work alone, Captain.\"\n\nThe captain stared at him with wide eyes.\n\n\"What kind of bullshit are you spouting? Have you hit your head repeatedly on something hard, Sunny? You work alone... what? I don't care what your preference is, this is Mirage PD. There are rules that even bastards like you have to follow.\"\n\nHe shook his head, then sighed and waved his hand.\n\n\"If you are worried that it's someone I am sending to spy on you, don't. This is a... different kind of situation. She's a good kid — a former national athlete with a rousing story of overcoming adversity. She's the pride of the nation, the pride! You get it? We were all celebrating when someone like that enrolled in the Police Academy!\"\n\nThe old man sighed wistfully.\n\n\"She graduated first in her class, too, and did exceptionally well as a patrol officer. As a result, she was on a swift track to making detective before, well… anyway, now that she is back from an extended maternity leave and freshly promoted to the Homicide Division, I want you to show her the ropes. And be nice about it!\"\n\nSunny studied the captain dubiously.\n\n\"Actually, I don't get it. That's the whole reason?\"\n\nThe old man looked at him with distaste, then sighed again.\n\n\"Well... and she looks great on a poster. Not that a thug like you will understand the importance of a clean and stirring image. So, when the reporters besiege you — and you know they will, considering the case — I want you to plant her firmly in front of the cameras and take a step back. Better yet, take three steps and get out of the shot, your morose bastard. You don't like dealing with public relations anyway, so it's a win-win.\"\n\nHe leaned forward and added in an even tone:\n\n\"In any case, it's not a discussion. It's an order. Either you take a partner and play ball, or I'll give the case to someone else.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, looking at the old man darkly.\n\n'So, he wants me to bring some washed-out mom around and let her stand in front of the cameras?'\n\nEverything inside Sunny rebelled against the idea of bringing someone whose only worth was looking comely into the hunt for the Nihilist. But he understood that if there was one thing the higher-ups cared about, it was the visuals.\n\nA national athlete — with some kind of inspirational story, no less — choosing the Police Department was a big win for the PR Division. Now that she was a proper family woman and a devoted mother, to boot, they were all probably salivating.\n\nSoftening the image of the traditionally rough and gruff, predominantly male-dominated police force was candy those scumbags could not resist.\n\nSo what if he had to carry dead weight around? Babysitting a weak, useless, and soft rookie was not the worst punishment.\n\nAnd if that poster girl… well, poster mom… ended up actually dead as a result, it would be on her. Not on him.\n\nSunny cursed quietly and then nodded.\n\n\"Fine. As long as she doesn't get in my way, I won't send her back to play house.\"\n\nThe captain gave him a long look.\n\n\"Great. She'll be waiting for you at the crime scene. Now, get the hell out of my office!\"\n\nSunny stood up and did just that, already thinking about what he would find at the scene of the murder.\n\n'That damn rain…'\n\nWater could wash away the blood, and at times, it could even wash away the corpses.\n\nBut it could not wash away sin.\n\nCleansing the city of sin was Sunny's job, and he was quite good at it — even if, in the process, more blood was spilled."

    "title": "2455 Floodgates.docx",
    "content": "2455 Floodgates\n\nThe usually calm river had swelled, the turbulent grey waters climbing high up the desolate shore. The shore itself had become a muddy mess, with its usual liveliness gone. A large area was cordoned off by police tape and hidden behind a scattering of vehicles parked in front of it, with a small crowd of passerby freezing in the rain behind the tape to satiate their curiosity.\n\nThe blinking lights of police sirens gave the scene an ominous, anxious hue.\n\nClimbing out of his car and raising the collar of his jacket to prevent the rain from seeping in, Sunny looked up with a dark expression.\n\nThe sky was heavy and dark, shedding tears with no reprieve. That was not what attracted his attention, though.\n\nThe idle onlookers crowding behind the police tape did not worry him, but the body had been found close to a bridge. There was a second crowd on that bridge now, busy snapping photos with their phones — from there, they had а perfect vantage point to the body laying on the edge of the water.\n\n'...Damn ghouls.'\n\nIt could not have been a coincidence that the body had been dumped here. Either the Nihilist dropped it off the bridge, or he simply wanted people to appreciate his work. If it was the latter, he had found a highly receptive, enthusiastic audience.\n\nCatching a patrol officer who was rushing past, Sunny pulled him back.\n\n\"Which asshole…\"\n\nThe cop turned around with an angry expression, but then paled and took an involuntary step back.\n\n\"D—detective Sunny, sir! You… you're here?\"\n\nSunny glared at him for a few moments, then nodded toward the bridge and said in a low, even tone:\n\n\"Are you blind or something? Yes, I am here. So, grab a few friends and go clear the pedestrian section of the bridge off, then block it. Bastard, do I need to tell you how to do your job?\"\n\nIf there had been any evidence left on the bridge, it was for sure destroyed by now. Someone deserved to be fired for this negligence, but Sunny knew that nobody would.\n\nThe cop trembled, then saluted and swiftly disappeared from view.\n\nShaking his head, Sunny climbed under the police tape and headed to the crime scene while putting on black latex gloves. There was a particularly large group of people crowding near the water, blocking his view — he knew that the body was there.\n\nAs he was approaching, he could hear them talking in hushed voices:\n\n\"Did you hear? Sunny is coming back today.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Oh, right… you're new. You wouldn't have met him yet.\"\n\n\"But who is Sunny, though?\"\n\n\"Fool, don't you know anything? You can cross anyone in Mirage Police, but you must never, ever cross that guy. He's fully insane, and not in a good way.\"\n\n\"Sunny, Sunny… w—wait, do you mean him? The Devil Detective?!\"\n\n\"Ah, so you do know about him. Well, I guess there's hope for you, still. Don't anger the Devil, man.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on… most of the stories they tell about him have to be lies. I bet I can take him, if push comes to shove.\"\n\n\"Damn, you turned out to be a moron. Listen… that one time, back in the day when he was in the Organized Crime Division, the boss of the Red Frog gang put a huge bounty on his head. So, twenty or so thugs cornered him in an underground market at night, all armed with knives and baseball bats. Do you know what happened next?\"\n\n\"W—what?\"\n\n\"A proper bloodbath is what happened. I was one of the first officers to arrive at the scene, so I saw it myself… when we opened the doors, it was like a slaughterhouse, man. He took them all down — a bunch died on the way to the hospital, the rest were crippled for life.\"\n\n\"Twenty men? Come on… no way…\"\n\n\"Shit, I was there, okay? He just walked out of that carnage, looking like a demon from hell, gave me a nasty glare, then got into a car without saying a word and drove straight to the bar where the Red Frog headquarters were. The next day, their boss surrendered himself to the police with a box full of evidence… well, what was left of their boss did, at least.\"\n\nIgnoring the whispers, Sunny unceremoniously pushed his way through the crowd of people. The cops grew silent when they saw him, moving to make way.\n\nNoticing someone he knew well, Sunny asked in a somber tone:\n\n\"Where's the medical examiner?\"\n\nThe man coughed a few times.\n\n\"Detective Sunny, sir… welcome back!\"\n\nSunny just stared at him, making the man shiver.\n\n\"I asked you a question, didn't I?\"\n\nThe cop lingered for a few moments, then sighed and gestured to the river.\n\n\"There is minor flooding in several areas further downstream, so lots of our guys are delayed by traffic jams. They'll be here soon… but we have a bit of a problem, sir. The water keeps rising, you see. The body was already found halfway in the river, but if it is not moved soon, the current might just carry it away. The other detective has been waiting to…\"\n\nSunny cursed and waved the man away.\n\nWalking through the mud, he approached the corpse. It was indeed laying on the very edge of the water, already submerged halfway. All Sunny could see were the dead man's legs and the lower section of his torso.\n\nLeaning down, he grabbed one of the corpse's legs and dragged the body out of the water.\n\nA ghastly, bloated face was revealed, missing both eyes.\n\n'Shit…\"\n\nJust as Sunny was about to take a better look, an easygoing voice resounded from behind, making him stop.\n\n\"Hey! Hey, buddy, what the hell are you doing? This is a crime scene, for fuck's sake. Who let a random civilian wander in?\"\n\nThe voice was unfamiliar and female.\n\n'So, this is the dead weight, then.'\n\nExhaling through gritted teeth, Sunny straightened аnd turned around, looking at the woman with a chilling expression.\n\nWell, or at least he had planned to.\n\nInstead, he froze for a moment… then slowly looked up.\n\nAnd then a bit more up.\n\nHis eyes widened a little.\n\n'What… the actual hell? This is the washed-out mom?!'"

    "content": "2456 Short Cop, Tall Cop\n\nWhen Sunny was informed that his new partner was a freshly pгomoted detective returning to work after an extended maternity leave — and one being pushed by the higher-ups for PR reasons, no less — he had imagined a comely woman who was well-suited to push the narrative of family values and nurturing care.\n\nA maternal figure to soften the harsh image of the unpopular Mirage PD.\n\nThat woman standing in front of him, however…\n\nWas so thoroughly not what he had imagined that he was stunned for a brief moment.\n\n'H—huh?'\n\nFirst of all, she wasn't just standing there… she was positively towering above him, as well as above the rest of the policemen gathered on the muddy shore. One of her ancestors had to have married a troll, or maybe an ogrе — some kind of a mountain giant, for sure. Otherwise, he could not explain her staggering height.\n\nDespite her questionable ancestry, though, the woman did not look like a troll. Instead... she looked like a supermodel. In fact, she was absolutely stunning, with a captivating face and a figure so gorgeous that it bordered on being deadly.\n\nAnd as if that was not enough, her well-proportioned athletic body was perfectly sculpted, with lean muscles that put even Sunny to shame. The woman was wearing an unassuming athleisure outfit and a raincoat, but he could tell how terribly in shape she was.\n\nIt was as if a goddess had stepped down from a painting.\n\nSunny blinked a couple of times, slowly reevaluating her opinions of his rookie partner.\n\n'Looks great on a poster, huh?'\n\nHe might have been a little wrong about the new captain.\n\nThe man knew what he was talking about.\n\nFrowning deeply, Sunny raised a hand and beckoned the woman to lean down. She glanced at him with amusement, then obliged, hiding a paper bag she had been holding behind her back.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nWhen her face was close enough to hear whisper, Sunny said loudly:\n\n\"Do I look like a civilian to you, moron?! I am investigating the body!\"\n\nWith that, he pulled out his badge from under the jacket and shoved it up under her nose.\n\nShe easily dodged the badge and looked at it in confusion. Then, the gaze of her stunning hazel eyes shifted back to Sunny, full of disbelief.\n\nShe seemed genuinely dumbfounded.\n\n\"Wha… you? You're the Devil Detective? But you're… you're tiny!\"\n\nSunny closed his eyes for a second and took a deep breаth.\n\nBehind his bombshell partner, there was a choir of frightened gasps.\n\n\"Oh no, oh no… we're all done for.\"\n\n\"He's going to kill her now, isn't he? \"\n\n\"No! Not Detective Effie!\"\n\n\"Should we call another ambulance?\"\n\nSunny exhaled slowly through gritted teeth, then opened his eyes and looked at his supposed partner.\n\n\"Yes, I am. And you… what's your name?\"\n\nThe woman seemed to have regained her composure. She straightened, saluted, and then gave him a brilliant smile.\n\n\"It's Effie! I'll be in your care, then!\"\n\nWith that, she offered him her hand for a handshake.\n\nSunny stared at the offered hand for a few moments, then turned away and concentrated on the corpse.\n\n\"Shut the hell uр and don't get in my way, Effie. Stay where you are and observe silently.\"\n\nShe lingered, then retracted her hand and sighed.\n\n\"So grumpy…\"\n\nIgnoring the woman, Sunny knelt near the corpse and studied its hideous, mutilated fаce. It had not been damaged too much by the water, but both of the dead man's eyes were missing…\n\nThat was the Nihilist's signature.\n\nEach of the seven victims had been killed in a unique way, but all of them were missing their eyes. The sick bastard took them for an unknown reason.\n\nThe prevailing theory was that he was collecting them as trophies.\n\nSunny was studying the body intently, a little thankful that he did not have to hear retching noises behind him. He had fully expected the rookie detective to become violently sick at the sight of the Nihilist's latest victim, but the recently promoted mom detective seemed to be taking the hideous corpse in stride.\n\nNo, actually…\n\nThere were strange sounds coming from behind him, after all.\n\nTurning around in displeasure, Sunny opened his mouth to say something… and froze for the second time today.\n\nHis unasked-for partner was standing where he had told her to stand. Her paper bag was open, and she was holding a half-finished sandwich in one hand, chewing with enthusiasm.\n\nSunny stared at her in disbelief.\n\n\"You're… eating?\"\n\nHis partner grinned sheepishly.\n\n\"Oh… sorry! I have a swift metabolism. So I snack a lot.\"\n\n'What the hell is wrong with this woman?'\n\nSunny stared at her for a while longer, then shook his head and turned back to the corpse.\n\n\"Bon appétit, I guess.\"\n\nAs he reached forward to move the dead man's head a little, the woman asked:\n\n\"What are you looking for, anyway? The cause of death is obviously strangulation. Those bruises on his neck are from the killer's fingers. The guy seems quite athletic, so to strangle him this way… takes a lot of strength. The Nihilist usually works with blades, right? I don't think he ever used brute strength before. Can it be a copycat?\"\n\nSunny grimaced, then let out a long sigh.\n\n\"Did I not say to be quiet?\"\n\nHe continued exploring it carefully.\n\n\"...I am looking for anything I can find. And it's not a copycat. The eyes were removed with the same surgical precision, which is not something just anyone can do. Plus, we never disclosed this detail to the press. And that bastard does not work with blades. He works with whatever is at hand. His MO is constantly changing, almost as if he likes to be inventive.\"\n\nHis partner whistled.\n\n\"Are we sure that the Nihilist is a man, by the way? I thought there were no clues.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a while.\n\n\"Not sure. But statistically, most serial killers are men. And… who said that there were no clues?\"\n\nAt that moment, he was holding one of the dead man's hands and checking under the sleeve.\n\nSuddenly, Sunny grew motionless.\n\n\"Shit.\"\n\nHis partner seemed to have finished her sandwich. Coming closer, she looked down over his shoulder and asked in a curious tone:\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nThere, on the dead man's pale skin…\n\nA little black snake was tattooed, coiling around his arm.\n\nSunny winced.\n\n\"It's a gang tattoo. This guy used to run with the Black Snakes.\""

    "content": "2457 Crash Course\n\nIt did not take long to identify the victim after discovering the tattoo. His data was in the system due to several juvenile offenses — as for the crimes he had been caught committing as an adult, there were none, because the poor guy was barely an adult.\n\n\"Gods. He's a kid.\"\n\nSunny gave his new partner a dark look.\n\n'...Did she just say \"gods\", plural?'\n\nOr had he heard wrong?\n\nCome to think of it, his poster girl of a partner looked terribly familiar. He felt like… no, he was convinced that he had seen her in his nightmares, and quite often at that. How could he have dreamt of people he had never met before, though?\n\nSunny sighed and rubbed his eyes tiredly, feeling both exhausted and incapable of falling asleep.\n\n'Get a grip, damn it… you really are going crazy.'\n\n\"Yeah, well. The gangs like tо recruit them young.\"\n\nHe would know. He had been one such underage thug himself, once.\n\nThe medical examiner finally arrived, and Sunny beckoned Effie away. Taking off his gloves, he tossed them into a trash bin, missed, then came back with a stifled curse to pick them up and put them into the bin properly.\n\n\"Let's go. We're done here.\"\n\nHis unreasonably gorgeous partner… Effie… looked around in confusion.\n\n\"Aren't we going to look around some more? Question the person who discovered the body, check for discarded evidence in the bushes, and so on?\"\n\nSunny gave her a disgruntled glare.\n\n\"There's no point. The body was either thrown down from the bridge or carried here by the river — in any case, the murder happened somewhere else. The patrol officers will examine the scene and question the witnesses. I doubt they'll find anything, though. The Nihilist is quite meticulous.\"\n\nHe walked over to his car, unlocked the door, and gestured to the passenger's seat.\n\n\"Get in.\"\n\nEffie gave the ramshackle car a dubious look, then sighed and squeezed herself inside. By the time Sunny climbed into the driver's seat, she was already chomping on another sandwich, which seemed to have appeared out of thin air.\n\nWhere was she hiding them?\n\n\"Wow, partner. I must say… I haven't seen a crappier vehicle in a while. Where did you get it, a museum?\"\n\nSunny started the car, then answered in an indifferent tone:\n\n\"Impound lot auction.\"\n\nThis unassuming black car had served him faithfully for the better part of a decade. It might have looked like it had seen better days... and drove like it was dreaming of going to car heaven... but it was still fast and reliable. He trusted it more than he trusted most people.\n\nEffie laughed.\n\n\"That checks out. Well, anyway… that psycho, the Nihilist. He's really something, huh?\"\n\nThe corner of Sunny's eye twitched.\n\n\"What he is is a pathetic loser. Nothing more, nothing less.\"\n\nHis new partner raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"The whole city is being terrorized by him, and despite that, the whole police force can't seem to catch him. How is he a loser?\"\n\nSunny looked at her briefly, then turned back to the road.\n\n\"I am not going to give you a crash course in criminal profiling, but you need to know one thing about serial killers — despite how much the media likes to turn them into some kind of great and sinister figures, fundamentally, they are all pathetic losers.\"\n\nHis expression darkened.\n\n\"Most of them are products of childhood abuse, mental or physical — usually perpetrated by their mothers. So, they are either working up to committing some kind of perverse matricide, making up for losing their chance to commit it, or trying to relieve the rush of having committed it. There's more nuance to it, of course, but basically… they're disgusting. Oh, and by the way, they are not only losers, but also cowards. Most serial killers choose victims who are weaker than them and don't pose a threat — women, children, the elderly… you get the picture.\"\n\nHe remained silent for a while, then let out a resentful sigh.\n\n\"Of course, that bastard, the Nihilist, does not exactly fit these criteria. There is no apparent pattern to how he chooses victims, which means that they most likely do not serve as a surrogate for the person he really wants to kill. More than that, he goes after everyone and anyone, weak or strong. His killings appear both premeditated and impulsive… so, trying to profile him is all but useless. Hell, we might as well throw the entire book away when dealing with him.\"\n\nEffie finished her sandwich with a thoughtful expression on his face.\n\n\"So, how are we going to find out who he is?\"\n\nSunny turned his head and studied her for a while.\n\nEventually, he looked away and said evenly:\n\n\"We don't need to find out who he is. I already know who he is. We just need to find concrete evidence to put him behind bars.\"\n\nEffie seemed stunned.\n\n\"What? You know who the Nihilist is?\"\n\nSunny looked ahead, his eyes turning cold and murderous.\n\n\"...Yeah. I do.\"\n\nShe remained silent for a while, studying him with a strаnge expression.\n\n\"How come no one else knows, then? Isn't he supposed to be a complete mystery? \"\n\nSunny smiled crookedly.\n\n\"Your second question answers the first. No one knows who he is because no one is supposed to know.\"\n\nEffie blinked a couple of times, then frowned.\n\n\"Somebody is suppressing the information? Wait… is someone covering for him?\"\n\nSunny glanced at her, wondering if she was being sincere or simply pretending not to know. For some reason, he felt inclined to trust his new partner… which was not at all like him. However, she had been pushed onto him by the superiors, which put her true allegiances under question.\n\nEventually, he shrugged.\n\n\"Someone is covering something, that is for sure. As for who and why — don't ask questions about things you are not qualified to learn, гookie. You'll live longer.\"\n\nShe opened her mouth to retort, but before she could, he added in a cold tone:\n\n\"Evidence. Without evidence, nothing you and I might think we know matters. So, keep an open mind and follow the evidence — inheriting my suspicions will only cloud your judgment.\"\n\nEffie gave him a long look, then giggled.\n\n\"Wow, partner! You almost sounded like a real detective just now!\"\n\nSunny grimaced.\n\n\"What the hell are you talking about? I am a real detective.\"\n\nShe remained silent for a while, studying him with a strange expression. Her mask of carefree nonchalance seemed to crack a little, revealing a hint of the keen and astute person hiding beneath.\n\nEventually, Effie leaned back and asked something odd:\n\n\"Hey. Do you… do you really not remember?\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow, confused.\n\n\"Remember what?\"\n\nShe hesitated for a few moments.\n\n\"Who you are?\"\n\nHe frowned deeply.\n\n'What is that supposed to mean?'\n\n\"Are you drunk or something, fool? I am Sunny, a detective from the Homicide Division of Mirage PD. Your senioг.\"\n\nEffie studied him for a few moments more, then smiled sheepishly, seeming perfectly laid-back and easygoing once again.\n\n\"Sorry, senior! I meant… you're the infamous Devil Detective, after all! That's all.\"\n\n'What a weirdo.'\n\nLetting out an amused scoff, Sunny pressed a little harder on the gas.\n\nHe didn't mind weirdos.\n\nTo be honest, he was not the most sane person himself."

    "content": "2458 Black Snake Gang\n\n\nThe car had left the more prosperous part of the city and entered the poorer parts. The buildings were older and more ramshackle here, the streets were narrower, and the people were dressed in cheaper clothes. The terrain of the city was uneven, littered with hills and mountains — more so here than in the center.\n\nAs a result, some of the sloping streets were covered in rushing water, with deep puddles collecting at the bottom. Driving through these puddles in Sunny's old car would have been a problem, but he knew the complicated labyrinth of streets like his own five fingers, avoiding the worst of it with ease.\n\nThat fact had not escaped Effie. She looked around with interest, then asked:\n\n\"Where are we going, anyway?\"\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"Where else? We are going to the Black Snake lair.\"\n\nShe seemed more amused than frightened by the prospect. Usually, a woman as attractive as her would have been wise to avoid entering a vicious gang's territory… but then again, this bombshell in particular seemed better suited to cracking skulls than most thugs were, so maybe they were the ones who had to be nervous.\n\n\"Just like that? Wait, how do you even… ah, right. You worked in the Organized Crime Division before, right?\"\n\nSunny gave her a sideways glance.\n\n\"Yes. Something like that.\"\n\nHe lingered for a few moments, then sighed and said:\n\n\"Gangs were all over the city not too long ago — even ten years ago, they controlled these parts of Mirage City entirely. A single day rarely passed without someone ending up dead, not to mention all the vile crap going on in the shadows. The cops were either on the payroll or too afraid to do anything, and those who did try tended to be disposed of swiftly.\"\n\nSunny smiled crookedly, remembering his youth.\n\n\"Times change, though. The political climate shifted, and being tough on crime became a rallying cry for the ruling party. So, the Police Department was cleansed… mind you, it wasn't cleansed of corruption. The corrupt bastards being paid by the criminals were just swapped out for corrupt bastards being paid by the politicians. Well, and a few capable people managed to get themselves into key positions in all the chaos.\"\n\nHe fell silent for a while.\n\n\"Captain Jet was one of them — although she wasn't a captain back then, just yet. Actually... I only ended up becoming a cop because of her. Then, somehow, we ended up being partners in the Organized Crime Division, with her spearheading the crackdown on the gangs. Those were… intense years, to say the least.\"\n\nEffie chuckled.\n\n\"Captain Jet, huh? Wait, where is she now?\"\n\nSunny did not answer for a while, his knuckles turning white on the wheel.\n\nEventually, he said in an even tone:\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\nThat was one of the reasons for his sorry state.\n\nThe main reason, really.\n\n...And here he was, side by side with a new partner.\n\nSunny looked at the rookie detective somberly.\n\n'I'm not responsible for her.'\n\nPutting this woman in front of the cameras might be a great PR move for the Mirage PD… but it also painted a target on her back. She had to know it, but she was still here — so, it was her own decision.\n\nHe had nothing to do with it.\n\nTurning back to the road, he said:\n\n\"Well, anyway. Most of the gangs were demolished back then, and those that remain are merely shadows of their former selves. They know their place, doing a bit of dirty business that everyone takes part in, but pгetends that it's the most abhorrent thing in the world publicly. Others went clean and are now managing slimy, but perfectly legal, businesses. The Black Snakes, though…\"\n\nHe frowned.\n\n\"The Black Snake is the only gang that is still somewhat of a real deal. So, when we get there…\"\n\nEffie grinned.\n\n\"Oh! Let's do the good cop, bad cop routine! I always wanted to! Can I be the bad cop? Please?\"\n\nSunny gave her a dubious look.\n\nHad she really graduated from the Academy at the top of her class?\n\nWell… he could easily imagine all the examiners being too distracted drooling at the sight of this particular cadet to give her objective marks…\n\nHe pursed his lips and shrugged.\n\n\"Sure. You can be the bad cop.\"\n\nThe car came to a halt in front of a seedy building. It was not what one would imagine when thinking about a gang's headquarters, though — the lair of the Black Snakes was not a bar, a night club, or an illegal casino. Instead, it was an old, seemingly rundown boxing gym.\n\nClimbing out of the car, Sunny waded through the rain and approached the front door. There was a muscular man in a training suit hiding under the canopy there, smoking somberly.\n\nWhen he saw Sunny, the man's eyes widened a little. He stood there frozen for a moment, then silently threw away his cigarette and disappeared inside.\n\nSunny picked up the cigarette, tossed it into the nearby trash bin, and followed. His rookie paгtner was on his heels, looking around curiously.\n\n'She's way too relaxed.'\n\nThe woman was either too confident in herself or had a screw loose.\n\nEntering the boxing gym, they saw a scattering of rough-looking men. Some were busy abusing punching bags, some were playing cards at a plastic table, some were watching two muscular thugs having a spar in the ring.\n\n…Some were already moving behind Sunny and Effie, locking the door.\n\nHe frowned slightly when he heard the sound of the bolt locking into place.\n\nOne of the men at the table looked back, then smiled and rose from his seat. The guard was standing nearby, having already reported something to him.\n\nThe man walked over to stand in front of Sunny and Effie. He stared at the former coldly, then shifted his gaze and leered at the latter.\n\n\"Hey there, sweetie…\"\n\nEffie smiled, too, then suddenly put on a furious expression and bellowed:\n\n\"Listen up, assholes! We're from Mirage City PD. I am Detective Wow, and this is my partner, Detective Meh. We are going to ask you some questions, and if you bastards do not spill your guts… well, then, do not blame us for spilling them for you!\"\n\nThe crowd of thugs was completely surrounding them by then, glaring at the two cops with an unrestrained hostility.\n\nThe man standing right in front of them remained silent for a few moments, then looked back at Sunny and raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Hey to you, too… rat. I must say, you have some nerve showing up here, rat. And you brought your girlfriend, too… what's up with her, anyway?\"\n\nSunny stared at him silently for a second or two, then shrugged.\n\n\"She's playing the bad cop, you see.\"\n\nThe man laughed.\n\n\"Oh? Really? Wait, are you the good cop then, rat?\"\n\nSunny lingered a little, then slowly shook his head.\n\n\"No…\"\n\nWith that, he calmly delivered a vicious punch to the thug's face, sending the man crashing to the ground with a torrent of blood spilling from his broken nose.\n\nSunny looked at the surrounding thugs coldly.\n\n\"...I'm the worse cop.\""

    "title": "2459 Gang Violence.docx",
    "content": "2459 Gang Violence\n\n\"What are you waiting for?! Kill these bastards!\"\n\nThat was what the senior thug had wanted to say… however, since he was choking on blood and clutching his face with both hands, what actually came out of his mouth was a jumbled, angry howl.\n\nSunny was already turning to face the other Black Snakes, whilе his partner was still frozen in shock. Her eyes were opened wide, and there was a stunned expression on her face.\n\n\"H—hey! That was not very… detective-like…\"\n\nShe did not have time to say anything else, because by then, the thugs finally realized what had happened and lunged at them.\n\n'Tsk, tsk… things have really gone to shit after I left.'\n\nSunny knew some of these men, even if he had not seen them in a long, long while. Most were strangers... however, he only needed one look to determine that the Black Snake gang was not what it used to be.\n\nThere was no real viciousness in these men, no chilling readiness — desire, even — to take lives or lose their own. They were no killers. The Black Snakes had grown soft and fat on the money they were making from their sordid business without competition, and on the handouts they received from the powers that be, who occasionally needed thеm to do the dirty work.\n\nIt made sense, really. Those of them who had been the real deal would not have bowed down to the new authority, and therefore, they were either dead or rotting in prison by now. Only the trash remained.\n\nSo, even though there were close to twenty thugs in the boxing gym, all of them bursting with muscle and well-trained…\n\nReally, all Sunny had to do was take out the trash.\n\nInstead of waiting for the crowd of Black Snakes to descend upon him, he dashed forwaгd to meet them instead. His heart was cold, and his mind was clear. There was no point in getting worked up about this scuffle… it was simply a chore.\n\nSure, if these twenty men had been determined and really knew how to work together, he would have been overwhelmed in mere moments. But they were men of inferior quality — thugs, not fighters. That gave him the initiative to hurt the first few, and once the rest sаw it, their resolve would be shaken.\n\nTheir fear and hesitation would become their undoing.\n\nSunny might have been a featherweight, but his fists were anything but light. He knew where to hit to inflict as much pain as possible, and how to deal as much damage as possible. He also had a lot of experience — too much, really — fighting with his life at stake. His first strike connected with the solar plexus of the swiftest thug, sending shock through the larger man's nerves and forcing him to stagger. A split second later, a vicious uppercut sent the thug falling to the floor with a suffocated scream.\n\nDiving under the slow and sloppy punch of the next bruiser, Sunny ruthlessly kneed him in the groin, then slammed his elbow on the back of the poor bastard's head.\n\nThe third was already upon him… and that one had to serve as a lesson for the rest.\n\nCatching the man's arm, Sunny moved like a ghost to twist it, and then brought his palm down on the elbow joint.\n\nA disgusting squelching crunch was drowned out by a piercing shriek of pain.\n\n'Strange…'\n\nSunny knew himself well, and he knew that he was a fierce fighter. But this… this felt almost too easy, as if he had become many times more skilled and experienced without noticing. As if fighting two dozen thugs who were more than willing to break and maim him was no big deal — inconsequential and pitifully trifling, even.\n\nNot in any way comparable to the great and dreadful battles he had fought in his nightmares.\n\nCould one's combat skills improve in a dream?\n\nLetting go of the screaming man's mangled arm, Sunny push-kicked him in the side of the head and looked at the rest of the thugs with a mad glint in his eyes.\n\n'Three down, seventeen to… huh? Thirteen to go?'\n\nIn the time it took Sunny to bring down three thugs — which was no more than a few seconds — his oddball of a partner had not been wasting her time, either. Honestly, he had not known how the rookie would react, and did not really care… but what he did not expect was that he would act without any delay at all, joining the fight with the same relaxed attitude.\n\nEffie simply grabbed two thugs by the sides of their heads and slammed them together, all but cracking their skulls, then delivered a picture-perfect roundhouse kick to a third one, folding the man in half and sending him flying back into his buddies. She finished it all up by simply slapping the fourth one to the ground.\n\nThrough all of it, she seemed calm and unruffled, amused even… no, she was definitely having fun.\n\n'What… the hell kind of mom is she?'\n\nSunny was surprised, somewhat dismayed at the fact that the rookie had taken down one more thug than him… and a little disturbed.\n\nThat calmness, that judgment, that effortless skill was not something a green and inexperienced detective was supposed to possess. Effie had been an athlete before becoming a cop, and although she did spend some time as a patrol officer, that alone could not have made her into a bloodied fighter.\n\nThese qualities were something people only developed after a lifetime of conflict and bloodshed.\n\nEither Sunny did not know something about his easygoing partner and was thus underestimating her… or she was not who she seemed.\n\nHis paranoia suddenly rose like a tide, making his eyes narrow.\n\nBut he had no time to dwell on the strange and ominous incongruity between who Effie was supposed to be and who she really was. First, he needed to deal with the Black Snakes.\n\nSeeing seven of their own go down in a matter of seconds, the thugs were getting serious. Before, they had been planning to beat the two cops to a pulp with their fists… probably do some other, way more vile things to them. But now, Sunny saw knives and steel pipes appearing in their hands.\n\nHe smiled darkly.\n\n'Don't blame me for being ruthless, then.'"

    "content": "2460 On the Count of Three\n\nSome time later, the floor of the boxing gym was littered with groaning, weakly moving bodies. The air was heavy with the stench of blood.\n\nSunny studied his bruised knuckles for a moment, then pushed a finger through a long cut on the side of his jacket and let out an irritated sigh.\n\n\"Now I'm going to be wet from the damn rain. Great.\"\n\nHe took off the jacket, revealing his arms — and the scales of the black serpent coiling around them.\n\nIf Effie was surprised to see a gang tattoo on the skin of her partner — one much more grand and vast than the ones covering the groaning thugs, no less — she did not show it. Instead, she rummaged around the table where the Black Snakes had been playing cards with a focused expression. Ignoring the alcohol and the piles of money, she picked up a bag of potato chips and smiled in satisfaction.\n\nSending one into her mouth, she asked with curiosity:\n\n\"Not to be a stickler for the rules, but haven't we broken at least a dozen laws just now?\"\n\nSunny gave her a long look, then scoffed.\n\n\"Who's going to report us? They?\"\n\nThe groaning thugs were a pitiful sight, and they were definitely not going to bring the attention of the cops to themselves — let alone let the news that a couple of cops wiped the floor with them spread.\n\nShaking his head, Sunny walked over to the ring, leaned down, and dragged one of the Black Snakes from under it by the leg. This one was whom he had punched first — the leader of this sorry bunch.\n\nThe lower part of his face was painted with blood, and his broken nose was swollen, sticking at a wrong angle.\n\nNevertheless, he gave Sunny a hateful gaze.\n\n\"What... kind of a damn demon are you... you're dead, rat! When the bosses find out, you're going to die…\"\n\nSunny gave him a cold look, then reached forward and unceremoniously set the man's broken nose. As soon as a sharp scream turned into a pained groan, he patted the thug on the shoulder.\n\n\"There, there. I set it for you. We can't have you growing even uglier than you are now, can we?\"\n\nThe man shivered under his ruthless gaze, pressing himself into the side of the ring.\n\nSunny remained silent for a few moments, then smiled dangerously.\n\n\"And hey, buddy, I think you need to get your facts straight. I am not a rat… a rat would have gone behind the backs of the bosses to sell them out to the cops. I told them that I was leaving fair and square, looking them in the eye. It's not my fault they weren't inclined to agree, is it? By the way, that is why you have new bosses now. The old bosses didn't scare me, did you think these new losers would?\"\n\nLeaning down, he whispered into the man's ear:\n\n\"Tell them to come find me. Hell, tell them I am waiting. That'll make my day.\"\n\nHe straightened and looked at the shivering thug with a complete lack of emotion in his black eyes.\n\n\"But then again, you'll have to be alive to tell them anything. And whether you'll live through the next few minutes… is completely up to you.\"\n\nEffie, who had wandered close, gave him a reproachful look and sighed.\n\n\"...I was supposed to be the bad cop, though!\"\n\nSunny ignored her. Instead, he produced his cracked phone and showed the thug a photo of the Nihilist's latest victim.\n\n\"Recognize him?\"\n\nThe man tried to reel back, but he had nowhere to go.\n\n\"Shit! What the… what the fuck is that?! Get that crap away from me, damn it!\"\n\nSunny blinked a few times.\n\n\"What, have you not seen a corpse before?\"\n\nHe chuckled, then put the phone back into his pocket and told the thug the dead kid's name.\n\n\"He's one of yours, isn't he? You see, my partner and I came here with sincere intentions, wanting to help you guys bring the murderer to justice. There was no need to be so inhospitable, really. But since things already turned out the way they did… I guess you'll just have to tell us everything we need to know anyway.\"\n\nThe thug glared at Sunny and hissed through gritted teeth:\n\n\"Do you think I'll tell you anything, rat?! Dream on!\"\n\nWithout saying a word, Sunny punched him in the face, dislodging the man's nose again.\n\nThere was another desperate scream, and Effie winced, taking a step back to continue munching on her potato chips.\n\n\"If I were you, I'd just tell him everything he wants to know. There's a limit to what plastic surgery can achieve, after all. There has to be something left of your nose for them to restore it…\"\n\nSunny took a deep breath.\n\n\"Did I not tell you to stop calling me rat, bastard? Look what you made me do. Let's try it again, shall we? The kid — tell us everything there is to know about him. When was the last time you saw him? What was his job? Which part of the city did you have him working? Who were his friends? And so on.\"\n\nThe thug had raised both hands to shield his face, looking at Sunny through the tears that had veiled his eyes because of the pain. He remained silent for a while, and then barked angrily:\n\n\"I don't know! I don't know, you asshole! Okay?! He's not one of ours!\"\n\nSunny stared at him darkly.\n\n\"Hey, friend. Do I look easy to you? Do you think I can't recognize a Black Snake mark when I see it?\"\n\nThe thug shook his head desperately.\n\n\"No, wait! I mean it! He… he used to be a junior member, up until a couple of years ago. But we haven't seen him since!\"\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"Huh? Since when is the Blacκ Snake gang in the habit of losing track of its junior members?\"\n\nThe thug lowered his hands and glared at Sunny, then grimaced and spat a mouthful of blood on the floor.\n\n\"What the hell do you know, Devil? The gang… is not what it used to be. Times have changed, damn it! It used to be that there we could just scoop up useless kids from the streets — little shits like you fought for the right to join us. But now, recruiting them is hard, and keeping hold of them is even harder.\"\n\nHe grimaced.\n\n\"Especially after those bastards opened doors. A damn charitable organization… they house them, educate them, support them financially, and even give them proper jobs. We lost a bunch of junior members to those assholes — this guy was one of the kids who left the gang and became a squeaky clean member of society thanks to them.\"\n\nSunny and Effie looked at each other.\n\n\"A charitable organization? What charitable organization?\"\n\nThe thug cursed under his breath.\n\n\"Mirage City Center for Troubled Youths… it's a private charity run by the Valor Group. You think we can compete with a damn conglomerate?!\"\n\nSunny stared at him for a while, and then smiled viciously.\n\nThis… this was what he needed.\n\nThis was the thread he would pull to unravel the case!\n\n\"Valor Group, huh?\"\n\n***\n\nSoon enough, they left the upturned boxing gym and returned to the car. Effie seemed thoughtful… or maybe she was just wondering where to get more food. At this point, Sunny could not be sure.\n\nHe lingered in front of the car, soaking in the rain. She waited for a while, then gave him a confused look.\n\n\"What, are you sad that we hit a dead end? This whole Black Snake lead turned out to be meaningless.\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"No, I'm not sad. And it wasn't meaningless… in fact, it was quite a fruitful visit.\"\n\nThen, he turned to the tall beauty and looked at her somberly.\n\n\"Listen… partner. Things are going to get interesting from here. So, I need you to tell me something honestly.\"\n\nShe smiled innocently.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\nNot sharing her laidback tone, Sunny asked bluntly:\n\n\"Who the hell are you? Oh, and think carefully before answering. You might end up dying heroically on your first day as a detective if you don't. Killed by the vicious gang members… it will be a real tragedy.\"\n\nThe threat in his tone was apparent. He was saying that he would kill her if she tried to lie.\n\nSunny would have loved for his threat to be a joke, but it wasn't. The Nihilist case was far more dangerous than even those terrified of the elusive serial killer suspected — that was because it involved people whom a mere cop like him could not dare to touch.\n\nThose people would not hesitate to make a troublesome cop disappear… they could, for example, insert one of their operatives into the case and force the higher-ups of the Police Department to saddle Sunny with that operative as a partner — to keep an eye on him, and dispose of him if need be.\n\nHe was not sure that Effie was a double agent, but he knew that she was not who she appeared to be.\n\nHis supposed partner stared at him for a while, silent. There was a hint of a odd emotion in her eyes… unease? Uncertainty? Fear?\n\nBut a split second later, it was gone.\n\nEffie laughed and reached to slap him on the shoulder with her usual easygoing smile.\n\nHer hand remained there, holding him lightly.\n\n\"What are you on about, Sunny? Snap out of it.\"\n\nSunny tensed, preparing to strike…\n\nAnd then, something odd happened.\n\nHe snapped out of it.\n\nA shiver ran through his body, and he looked around with a startled expression.\n\nA strange city. Pouring rain. Air that smelled neither like the sterile cleanliness of NQSC nor the poisonous miasma of the outskirts. Unfamiliar buildings; a weird PTV of archaic design.\n\nShifting his gaze to the boisterous huntress, Sunny blinked a couple of times.\n\n\"Effie? What the hell?\""

    "content": "2461 Brave Old World\n\nSunny swayed, struggling to stay on his feet.\n\n'Ah! D—damnation!'\n\nHe was impossibly weak! He was terribly frail! He was beaten and battered, exhausted beyond imagination, and ready to collapse! His body was torturously slow and clumsy, and on top of that, he was limited to only being aware of what was in front of his eyes. The shadows did not respond to his senses, and without them, he felt blind like a bat.\n\nIt seemed impossible that anyone could exist in this pitifully powerless, woefully limited, and creepily dull state.\n\n'Wait… isn't that… simply what being mundane felt like?'\n\nSunny blinked a few times in complete shock.\n\nRight, he was not under some harrowing hex that maimed his body and soul. He was simply reduced to being mundane once again. In fact, he was far stronger, faster, and resilient than he had ever been as a mundane person — after all, he was currently in a somewhat ragged, but still trained and tampered body of a well-fed adult, not that of a malnourished teenager.\n\nHe was Detective Sunny of the Mirage City Police Department.\n\n'What the actuаl…'\n\nBefore, his memories seemed like a dream, while the Devil Detective's personality felt like his true self. Now, the positions were reversed — Sunny was himself once again, while the memories of the jaded detective felt like a vague, distant dream.\n\nThe senses of his other incarnations were just as vague, as if reaching him through a vast mass of water… or maybe through the silver surface of a great mirror.\n\nHe was in a mundane body. He did not have his Aspect or his Attributes, no essence, no cores. His Domain was gone. He did not have his shades and Shadows, either… while his own shadow was not an invaluable helper anymore! It was just silent and unresponsive, following him like a dead thing.\n\nJust a few moments before, this simplistic and inadequate state of existence seemed perfectly normal to him. But now, Sunny felt like he had been crippled — like all his limbs had been severed, and all his senses were dulled!\n\nIt felt terrible.\n\nHe grabbed Effie's hand desperately and used it as support to keep himself from falling. A low groan escaped from his lips, followed by a stifled curse.\n\n\"Curses...\"\n\nAs Sunny was trying to come to terms with being mundane once again, a perplexed voice resounded above his head.\n\n\"Hey there, buddy… are you alright? Mr. Devil Detective?\"\n\nLooking up in dismay, Sunny grimaced and spat through gritted teeth:\n\n\"What damn Devil Detective?! No, I'm not alright! I am… mundane? !\"\n\nEffie stared at him in confusion for a couple of moments. Then, her eyes widened.\n\n\"Shadow Boy? Is that really you?! You remembered?!\"\n\nSunny let go of Effie's hand and straightened, slowly regaining his composure.\n\n\"Stop calling me Shadow Boy, damn it! And… yes, it's me. I did remember. How the hell…\"\n\nBut before he could finish talking, Effie suddenly pressed her palm against his mouth, shutting him up. Surprise and confusion drained from her eyes, replaced by alarm. Looking around warily, she remained silent for a few moments, and then said:\n\n\"Not here. Not where someone can hear us. How about… we go find somewhere more private to talk?\"\n\nSunny frowned, then gestured to the car. It was only then that Effie removed her hand and grinned.\n\n\"Well then, let's go, partner! Personally, I — a rookie homicide detective of Mirage PD — am starving. What about you?\"\n\nHe wanted to retort, but couldn't… because now that he was mundane, he suddenly needed to eat food as sustenance again. So, actually, Sunny was quite hungry too.\n\n'..What a chore.'\n\n\"Yeah. I can eat.\"\n\nShe studied him for a moment, then nodded and climbed into the car. Sunny did, as well, finding himself in the driver's seat. A completely unfamiliar control system met him, which he somehow knew how to operate. After spending a few seconds studying the weird PTV's dashboard, Sunny inserted the key into the ignition with a dubious expression, then gave it a tentative turn.\n\nThe PTV roared with a level of noise that could only be called obnoxious, vibrated like a trembling animal dying from fear in front of a predator, and spat a thick stream of noxious gas from its back.\n\nSunny blinked a few times, aghast at the barbarity of this primitive machine, and looked at Effie.\n\nHe had already surmised that the odd world they had found themselves in resembled the waking world before the Dark Times, but this… this was an entirely new level of absurdity.\n\n\"...Did people really drive these monstrous things?\"\n\nEffie arched an eyebrow.\n\n\"How would I know?\"\n\nSunny put his hands on the wheel and sighed.\n\n\"Fair.\"\n\nHe spent a few moments allowing the muscle memory of the Devil Detective to take over, and a few more convincing himself to trust it. Then, he drove off, painfully aware that since he was somehow a mundane human again, driving the archaic PTV into a street lamp may very well result in his death.\n\nIt was really quite offensive. Him, the Sovereign of Death? Being killed by a street lamp? Who the hell would actually go and die from something as frivolous as a high-speed collision?\n\nLuckily, he did not hit anything immediately, and after a minute or two, controlling the loud, stench-producing machine started to feel natural to him. He even got used to the weird vibrations until they blended into the background.\n\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\nEffie shrugged.\n\n\"Try to dig in the fake you's memory, find a rundown and desolate diner he used to frequent. Considering that grumpy malcontent's character, there should be at least one.\"\n\nSunny tried not to think about how weird the advice was and did just that. He tried to reach into the Devil Detective's memory, and after a while, a location did magically come to his mind, complete with the knowledge on how to get there.\n\n'...How convenient.'\n\nIt was very strange.\n\nHe narrowed his eyes and sent the PTV rolling in the right direction.\n\nBefore too long, though, it let out a series of strange noises and abruptly grew quiet, seemingly losing power. Sunny barely managed to park it at the side of the road before the vehicle completely lost momentum.\n\nBoth he and Effie were startled and confused.\n\n\"Huh? What… what is wrong with it?\"\n\nSunny stared at the unfamiliar dashboard, then turned the key this way and that. The PTV let out a few suffocating sniffles, but did not start again.\n\nThe two of them looked at each other. After a while, Effie offered a suggestion in an uncertain tone:\n\n\"Is it… out of power? Do we need to charge it?\"\n\nSunny scratched the back of his head.\n\n\"I'm not sure. Maybe? How do we charge this thing, though?\"\n\nHe thought for a bit, then said hesitantly:\n\n\"I think it's more like a military PTV than a normal one? I mean, it can self-charge if you deposit a fuel cell into it.\"\n\nEffie coughed.\n\n\"I, uh… I think they use liquid fuel? Some kind of petroleum derivative. That stuff was still abundant before the Dark Times.\"\n\nSunny stared at her with wide eyes.\n\n\"Are you crazy? What kind of idiot would fuel their vehicle with a flammable substance?\"\n\nEffie blinked a couple of times.\n\n\"Oh, this vehicle is using an internal combustion engine. Basically, it moves by harnessing the power of numerous tiny explosions. We learned about them in history class… that's why that thing over there is called the ignition!\"\n\nSunny laughed.\n\n\"Yeah, right.\"\n\nMillions of people riding around on streams of tiny explosions… Effie's jokes were really too much.\n\nNoticing that she was looking at him earnestly, though, Sunny slowly lost the smile.\n\n\"Wait, you're being serious?\"\n\nHe looked down, at the place where the PTV's engine was hidden, with a hint of horror in his eyes.\n\nAfter a while, Sunny inhaled deeply and shook his head.\n\n\"No wonder these people blew up half of the world…\""

    "content": "2462 Before the Dark Times\n\nIt took Sunny some time to remember that the Devil Detective had kept a canister of fuel in the trunk of the archaic PTV. Then, it took him some more time to figure out how to deposit the appallingly pungent liquid into the vehicle, all the while being soaked in rain and cursing under his breath.\n\nBeing in the rain actually made him uncomfortably cold. Sunny had almost forgotten the feeling of being powerless in the face of the elements, so it was somewhat of a novel experience for him. Needless to say, he climbed back into the PTV in a foul mood.\n\nLooking at Effie with a deep scowl, he suppressed a heavy sigh and asked:\n\n\"Is your mundane alter ego also a sleep-deprived, rage-fueled wreck craving nothing more than an unhealthy dose of nicotine and alcohol?\"\n\nShe laughed and shook her head.\n\n\"Nope. I am basically a shining example of how regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle are good for you. I mean, sure, becoming mundane all of a sudden was a bit disorienting… but actually, I am enjoying myself.\"\n\nBrimming with vitality, Effie gestured to her toned, tantalizing body.\n\n\"It's interesting. I was never both able-bodied and mundane — so, this is a new experience for me.\"\n\nSunny's stare turned bitter.\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nLooking away, he started the car and sent it rolling forward again.\n\nAs they drove to their destination, he could appreciate the vistas of Mirage City from a new perspective. Sunny knew, of course, what cities before the Dark Times looked like — but only from archival footage, webtoon illustrations, and movie sets. Seeing it all with his own two eyes, and in great detail, was completely different.\n\nHe couldn't help but feel put off by how different everything looked. There were no barriers surrounding the city, no alloy towers, no isolation domes around active Nightmare Gates peppered here and there. The air was of course breathable, and the citizens did not seem afraid of the rain, as if there was no possibility of it turning to acid.\n\nThe architecture was entirely foreign to what he was used to, and the buildings themselves were many times lower than they were in NQSC — despite the fact that they were built exclusively up, with almost no subterranean levels. There were no layers to the city, just one flat surface with hills and small mountains rising here and there.\n\nEverything seemed so… simple and relaxed, even if it had felt overwhelming and permeated by crushing tension to the Devil Detective.\n\n\"How large do you think this city is? \"\n\nEffie contemplated for a moment.\n\n\"Uh… I think it has a population of around ten million? Twenty-something millions, including the greater metropolitan area.\"\n\nSunny's eyes widened a little.\n\n\"Twenty million people? That's… that's tiny!\"\n\nFrom the impression he had gotten from the vague memories of the Devil Detective, Mirage City was a sprawling metropolis suffocating in a flood of human sins. However, ten million — even twenty or thirty — was positively a tiny amount. There had been many times more people living just in the outskirts of NQSC, let alone in the city itself, with its population in the hundreds of millions.\n\nMirage City… was a village!\n\nAnd despite that, it somehow managed to look crowded. Perhaps because everyone had somehow gotten a PTV license instead of using public transport like normal people did… as a result, not only was the air full of noxious fumes and noise, but the traffic also prevented anyone from getting anywhere in a timely fashion.\n\nPeople were simply stuck on the road, their vehicles crawling at such a low speed that even the pedestrians could outpace them. Nevertheless, the pedestrians — actual people — were reduced to a subservient species in their own city, fearfully clinging to the sides of the streets to make way for the actual dominant creatures, the PTVs.\n\nAnd those weren't even cargo PTVs, either — almost all of them were for personal use.\n\nIt didn't make any sense!\n\n'Does no one here notice how absurd the citation is? What is the city management doing?'\n\nNo… actually, if he remembered correctly, countless people did use a public transport network here — mostly the underground trains. It was just that the network was similarly inadequate and failed to serve even such a tiny population, resulting in overcrowding and unbearably bleak peak traffic hours.\n\nWell, that last part actually made sense. With the primitive technology of the days before the Dark Times and no spelltech, digging underground tunnels must have been a real chore. However, the very reason why they had to be dug underground in the first place was that the surface roads were usurped by personal vehicles.\n\n'Underground tunnels, huh…'\n\nSomewhere far away, one of Sunny's incarnations looked up with a glint in his eyes. Bastion was only starting to develop its own public transport networks, and there was no modern technology or spelltech in the Dream Realm either.\n\nHowever, there was Sunny.\n\nAnd Sunny had the shade of Abundance at his disposal. How long would it take the Sacred worm to create a vast network of tunnels under Bastion, to serve as the fоundation of a future metro system?\n\nNot long at all…\n\n'Should I discuss it with Cassie? We'll need some engineers, sure — well, a lot of them — but as long as they remain unaware of how the tunnels will be created and who will create them, it can work splendidly…'\n\nSunny was distracted for a while, and by the time he came back to his senses, they were already near the ramshackle diner the Devil Detective used to frequent.\n\nIf he was generous, the place could be called quaint and unassuming. If he wasn't, though, he'd call it a trash heap masquerading as an establishment where people were supposed to eat.\n\nThe diner was small, shabby, and exceedingly sparse in decor. There was no decor to be mentioned, really, just a few cheap tables with similarly cheap chairs. It was mostly used by blue-collar workers, so there were only guests here during the lunch hours and in the evening, when people got off work.\n\nAt the moment, the place was completely empty, with the exception of a grumpy waitress who disappeared somewhere immediately after delivering their order.\n\n…The food, however, wаs miraculous.\n\n\"Oh gods.\"\n\nSunny stared at Effie with wide eyes. Effie was similarly looking at him with an enraptured expression.\n\nThere was unlimited clean drinking water. Every dish was made entirely from natural ingredients, with not a single synthetic morsel in sight. The flavors were rich, the side dishes were fresh — and could be refilled endlessly! — and the portions were exceedingly generous. Despite all that, the meal was dirt cheap.\n\n'How is this possible?'\n\nVery few people in NQSC could afford to eat like this, and even those who could would have to pay a insane amount of credits for such an amazing meal. The situation was a little better in the Dream Realm, but even there, most food was still synthetic and being imported from the waking world.\n\n'Am I... in heaven?'\n\nFor a while, Sunny was uncomfortably similar to Effie, practically inhaling the delicious food with little to no table manners and ordering more and more of it.\n\nAfter a while, extremely satiated and feeling sleepy from all the food, he looked at her groggily and asked:\n\n\"By the way, why did you insist that we should talk in a private place?\"\n\nEffie leaned back, eased her waistband, and patted her flat belly with a deeply satisfied grin.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing major. Just that... we'll probably die horribly if the locals notice us breaking character…\""

    "content": "2463 The Lives of Others\n\nSunny lingered for a few moments, then threw a brief glance at the door behind which the waitress had disappeared. No one else was in the deserted diner, аnd the pedestrians rushing past the dirty window could not hear them.\n\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"How so?\"\n\nEffie let out a long sigh and poured herself a cup of water before speaking again. Eventually, she leaned back and said in a low tone:\n\n\"Well… I don't know how you came about, but I was home — the home of the newly promoted Detective Athena of Mirage PD, that is. A married woman with a loving husband and an adorable kid… a couple of adorable kids, actually, a boy and a girl. Needless to say, those were not my kids and not my husband. So, when he went for a kiss, I was understandably not having it.\"\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"Wait. You were aware of who you really are from the start?\"\n\nEffie nodded.\n\n\"Yes. We entered the Hall of Imagination… then, my memory is a bit hazy. The next thing I knew, I was standing in a living room, folding laundry. I was alone, mundane, and completely turned around. Before I could really figure out what had happened, I was assaulted by two overly enthusiastic kids who wanted to play cops and robbers with mommy.\"\n\nSunny scratched the back of his head.\n\n\"What the hell is cops and robbers?\"\n\nEffie scoffed.\n\n\"It's a local version of Awakened and Abominations, naturally. Anyway, yes, I was never under thе illusion that I was the real Detective Athena. The kids were sweet and adorable, so even though I was weirded out of my mind, I went along with what was happening and tried to slowly regain my bearings while playing with them. That was how I figured out the basic facts about this place and learned to rummage in my counterpart's memories. So, everything went well… until her husband showed up.\"\n\nSunny smiled darkly.\n\n\"What? Did you smack him when he went for a smooch?\"\n\nEffie let out a joyless chuckle.\n\n\"No… maybe I would have, but my instincts are still those of a Saint. You know how it is — we need to be careful around mundane people, so the thought of striking him never even crossed my mind. I just dodged away and let him know in no uncertain terms that there would be no smooching, kissing, squeezing, fondling, or canoodling of any kind.\"\n\nSunny gave her an exasperated look.\n\n\"I don't need the details, you know?\"\n\nShe grinned.\n\n\"Why, not a fan of canoodling? That is not what Neph…\"\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"Hey, lady. I am not a fan… I am the artist.\"\n\nEffie stared at him silently for a few long moments, then threw her head back and exploded with laughter.\n\n\"Oh… oh, gods! Did… did you really just say that?\"\n\nSunny raised his chin defiantly and suppressed a smile.\n\n\"I did. Not only did I say it, but I also meant every word.\"\n\nShe continued to laugh for a while longer, then wiped the tears off the corners of her eyes and looked at him with a wry smile.\n\n\"You know, Shаdow Boy… you are actually not that scary up close, are you?\"\n\nSunny shrugged.\n\n\"Not unless you are scared of innocuous stuff like dark demigods who command legions of dead souls and can damn you to eternal servitude, with not even death offering escape… I guess.\"\n\nEffie grinned.\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nShe studied him for a bit, then sighed.\n\n\"Well, in any case. The second I refused the affections of that man — the moment I broke character — something very creepy happened.\"\n\nHe frowned.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nEffie gulped down her water and looked into the distance with a somber expression.\n\n\"He… changed. Even creepier, though, was the fact that the kids changed, too. It was not that they turned into some grotesque nightmare creatures or displayed dreadful powers, they just… sort of froze, turned to look at me in eerie synchronicity, and stared. They still looked human, but there was nothing human about them at that moment. I don't know how to describe it, but there was something deeply wrong deep in their eyes. Something empty and utterly alien to what a human, or even an abomination, should be.\"\n\nSunny's frown deepened.\n\n\"Sounds… familiar.\"\n\nEffie nodded curtly.\n\n\"Yes. It was, indeed, familiar. In fact, I've seen eyes like those before.\"\n\nShe looked into the window, at the torrent of passersby rushing along under a river of umbrellas.\n\n\"I saw it during the war, in Bastion. When one of the Others pretended to be Aether.\"\n\nSunny's eyes narrowed, and a shiver ran down his spine.\n\n\"You mean…\"\n\nEffie looked at him darkly.\n\n\"Yes. My supposed husband, the adorable kids, the cops on the crime scene, the Black Snakes, the waitress who served us food… and the rest of those twenty million so-called people living in Mirage City... are all Others.\"\n\nSunny froze, suddenly ρaralyzed by fear.\n\nIt was not often that he felt fear these days…\n\nBut the thought of twenty million Others surrounding him from all sides more than deserved the honor of frightening him.\n\nIn fact, if Sunny's ability to feel frightened had not deteriorated awfully after more than a decade of suffering all kinds of horrors, he would have been utterly terrified right now. Turning his head slowly, Sunny looked at the constant stream of pedestrians outside the window, the flood of noisy PTVs behind them, and the crowded forest of tall buildings stretching beyond the horizon.\n\nSuddenly… Mirage City did not seem so tiny anymore.\n\nIt seemed like a boundless abyss containing unfathomable depths of terror instead.\n\nEffie grimaced.\n\n\"Look. You are a Supreme who has become a powerless mundane human. While they… they are the Others who were made into powerless mundane humans. And as long as everyone plays their roles faithfully, they are bound by these roles, unable to be anything but what their characters are supposed to be. Luckily, I resumed acting like Detective Effie in time, and my creepy family returned to being normal as if nothing had happened.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"So, you can understand why I had to be careful when we first met. I was happy to see you, but also, I wasn't sure that you were… you. I kept thinking — is this the real Lord of Shadows, or is this an Other who just happens to look like the Lord of Shadows? I couldn't just ask, since that would mean breaking character… so I decided to play along and see how things go.\"\n\nInhaling slowly, Sunny looked back at Effie, lingered for a few moments, and asked in an even tone:\n\n\"Are you sure that everyone here is an Other?\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"Reasonably sure. Naturally, nobody really knows that much about the Others. However…\"\n\nEffie sighed and poured herself more water.\n\n\"It would make sense, wouldn't it? Clan Valor had always been wary of the Others — that was because the Others sometimes escaped from the Great Mirror. They came from the other side of reflections… from True Bastion. But how did they come to be there, and where do they come fгom? Well, if the Great Mirror in False Bastion is really no more than a reflection of the true Great Mirror, then what if that is where they dwell? They are trapped inside the true Great Mirror, and now, we are too.\"\n\nSunny inhaled slowly.\n\n\"Yes, that… does make sense, I guess.\"\n\nEffie chewed her lip, then said quietly:\n\n\"It's that damn Demon of Imagination — Mirage, or whatever her name was. She created Rivergate, Bastion… and the Great Mirror. She must have put the Others into the hidden realm inside the Great Mirror, as well. Hell, she might have created the eerie creeps, for all we know.\"\n\nSunny tilted his head a little.\n\n\"But why would an illusory realm created by the Demon of Imagination resemble an Earth city from before the Dark Times? \"\n\nEffie looked around and smiled faintly.\n\n\"That is the question, isn't it?\""

    "title": "2464 Palace of Imagination.docx",
    "content": "2464 Palace of Imagination\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, contemplating, then said slowly:\n\n\"Unless… Mirage wasn't the one who created this city at all.\"\n\nEffie gave him a dubious look.\n\n\"If not the great and terrible Demon of Imagination, then who? This place is literally called Mirage City, for Spell's sake.\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"Think about it. Mirage might have created Bastion — both its true and illusory versions — but that is not all Bastion is. It has been taken by the Spell and turned into a Citadel… a Great Citadel, no less. So, just like with other Citadels, the Spell would have taken what made this place special and given its master a way to use it. Turning it into a Component.\"\n\nEffie wrinkled her nose.\n\n\"I don't follow. Are you saying that I, the current master of Bastion, created Mirage City?\"\n\nSunny shook his head again.\n\n\"No, I don't think that it was you. I think that someone has co-opted that Component of Bastion and created Mirage City in your stead.\"\n\nHe hesitated for a few moments, then added:\n\n\"Naturally, we don't know a lot about the Demon of Imagination. However, we know that her powers had to do with fantasies, illusions, and fanciful things — like fairytale castles rising from the clouds reflected on the surface of water. And that her hobbies included creating lakes and tinkering with mirrors.\"\n\nSunny smiled faintly.\n\n\"So, what would be hidden in the heart of her cloud castle? A awful weapon? A prison for eerie beings from the reflections? No. I think that this place — this dreadful city imprisoning millions of Others… is a playground.\"\n\nEffie laughed.\n\n\"Wait, a playground? First a toy room, now a playground... is this your weird way of making up for a dull childhood?\"\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"I wish. No… but I do think that this place, the Palace of Imagination, is created to be a playground of sorts. A realm where anything Mirage imagined would become reality — just like the illusory Bastion, only devoid of permanence, capable of changing according to her every whim. Complete with beings to populate that reality and play whatever roles she wanted them to. After all, the only thing the Demon of Imagination could not create was living beings — that was something only the gods could do. Well, and Nether.\"\n\nEffie leaned back and frowned.\n\n\"But… the Demon of Imagination is gone, and this playground of hers was turned into a Component of Bastion by the Nightmare Spell, thus allowing Awakened to control it.\"\n\nSunny nodded. \"Only the original masters of Bastion — Warden and Anvil — never discovered the Mirror Maze, and never made it to the Palace of Imagination. Instead, someone else slipped his way here, and made this place his.\"\n\nEffie's frown deepened.\n\n\"...Mordret.\"\n\nHer tone was not at all enthused. In fact, Sunny had rarely heard his easygoing friend sound so somber.\n\nHe was not too happy, either.\n\n\"It was either him or Morgan. Had to be. I don't know whether they created this city consciously or if the Great Mirror simply extracted the blueprint from their subconscious, but it was definitely one of them.\"\n\nEffie blinked а couple of times.\n\n\"Right. Morgan is also here, but we have no idea where either of them is…\"\n\nSunny smirked.\n\n\"Says who? Actually, I have already located both Morgan and Mordret. Oh, I also found Saint while I was at it.\"\n\nEffie blinked a few times.\n\n\"When did you… actually, never mind. Wow, Shadow Boy! You really do work fast. So fast, in fact, that it makes me wonder if you're as quick in…\"\n\nSunny gave her chair a kick under the table, winced at the pain in his mundane foot, and said:\n\n\"Mordret is the young CEO of the Valor Group… which is a private conglomerate that basically controls the city. The politicians, the courts, the police — pretty much everyone is in their pocket, so he is all but untouchable.\"\n\nEffie raised her eyebrows.\n\n\"What? How is that even possible? I mean… a private company having more power than the government, let alone the people? That sounds completely implausible, does it not?\"\n\nSunny shrugged.\n\n\"Sure, sounds far-fetched. But we are in an imaginary realm, remember? It's only reasonable that some things here will be entirely fantastical, not at all based in reality.\"\n\nHe wasn't sure how things worked before the Dark Times, but a society completely ruled by money and private interest seemed like too irrational a concept to have existed — human greed was boundless, after all, so who in their right mind would base a world order around that?\n\nImagining what would happen to the world if Aiko was in charge, Sunny was suddenly covered in cold sweat.\n\n'By the dead gods. Let's hope that she never becomes a Sovereign…'\n\nHe smiled weakly and shook his head.\n\n\"Well, think about the Great Clans. Could the government, let alone the people, have done anything against them? No. In that sense, the Valor Group is not that different from the Great Clan Valor.\"\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n\"Saint has become a hotshot psychiatrist in an elite, high-security mental hospital. While Morgan… Morgan is a patient in that hospital.\"\n\nEffie looked at him in surprise.\n\n\"What? Morgan is in a insane house?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Yes. I saw her myself… actually, she told me to find you. It was just that I had no idea who you were when she did.\"\n\nEffie frowned.\n\n\"Morgan knew who she was, too? That makes two of us who weren't brainwashed by this place, and one of you who was. What makes you different? No, wait… why did she tell you to find me? How did she even know that I am here with you?\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a little while, then shook his head.\n\n\"I don't know why you two weren't affected by Mirage City. As for the rest… I don't think Morgan knew that you were here. She told me to find you for a reason, though.Think about it… how did I regain my senses?\"\n\nEffie blinked a couple of times.\n\n\"Well. We roughed those thugs up, then you just sort of did? After I told you to snap out of it.\"\n\nSunny nodded again.\n\n\"Indeed. You touched me and told me to snap out of it. And I did. I don't think it was a coincidence, either — rather, I think that you have some authority here as the master of Bastion. That was why Morgan told me to find you.\"\n\nThat was indeed the most logical conclusion. Sunny would have loved to believe that he regained his senses thanks to the power of friendship — after all, Kai had managed to return him from the mire of Shadow Dance by reminding him of those he cared about — but he knew that something more was at play here.\n\nThis place, Mirage City, was no mere illusion. It was fantasy made reality, fueled by the fantastical power of the Demon of Imagination. It was no less real than any other place in the Dream Realm, and what Sunny had escaped from was not merely a delusion — it was the sorcery of a daemon.\n\nNo matter how highly he thought of himself, he knew he was not powerful enough to overcome the will of Mirage, the Demon of Imagination. Instead, he had regained his sense of self through a mechanism built by her into the Great Mirror.\n\nEffie grinned.\n\n\"Oh! It's nice to know that I have some authority here… not that I feel very authoritative. I don't think that I can control this place freely — nothing I tried really worked until now. It's as if something is blocking my way.\"\n\nSunny looked at her darkly.\n\n\"Well, naturally. After all, someone has stolen your… let's call it administrator rights.\"\n\nShe pursed her lips, pouting, then gave Sunny an inquisitive look.\n\n\"Darn thieves! What do we do, then? \"\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"Isn't it obvious? Find the bastard, get your control of the Component back, find what I am looking for, and get the hell out of here.\"\n\nSunny thought for a bit, and then added in a morose tone:\n\n\"Of course, it won't be very easy. Because we must achieve all that… while playing the roles of a jaded detective who doesn't play by the rules and his perky young partner flawlessly…\""

    "content": "2465 Buried Evidence\n\nEffie changed her posture and leaned forward a little. Then, she smiled languidly while looking at Sunny.\n\n\"Perky young partner, huh? Well, I sure am perky… thanks for noticing, I guess… but young? I think you'rе younger than me?\"\n\nSunny let out a heavy sigh and suppressed the desire to palm his face.\n\nHe stared the grinning woman in the eye and responded in a slightly disgruntled tone:\n\n\"Age is a relative. I might have been born a couple of years later than you, but have I lived less than you? At this point, even I am not sure. Among other things, I am living seven lives at the same time… does that mean that I am aging seven times faster? Who knows — I definitely don't. Point is, the Devil Detective is your counterpart's senior. So, treat me accordingly.\"\n\nEffie's grin widened a little, and her eyes glistened.\n\n\"Alright, Big Brother!\"\n\nSunny shuddered.\n\n\"No, no! None of that, never!\"\n\nShe batted her eyelashes innocently, then leaned back and shrugged.\n\n\"Well, whatever. In any case, what is our next step?\"\n\nSunny contemplated her question for a while. Eventually, he frowned.\n\n\"Our target is Mordret, the CEO of the Valor Group. Besides him, there are two secondary persons of interest — Saint and Morgan. Saint does not seem to remember herself, acting out the role assigned to her by the Great Mirror…\"\n\nThat of his inordinately gorgeous therapist. Who talked!\n\nSunny remembered the bizarre experience of seeing — and hearing — the human version of Saint. Now that he had regained his sense of self, he did not know how to feel about that. It was fascinating, a little thrilling… but mostly, it felt completely and utterly wrong.\n\nHe cleared his throat, then continued:\n\n\"You… must not know a lot about Saint, but she can become an extremely valuable ally to us — as long as we manage to remind her of who she is. More importantly, she can help us gain access to Morgan.\"\n\nHis expression darkened.\n\n\"Saint is valuable, but Morgan… Morgan is priceless. What we lack the most at the second is information, and she seems to know a lot about what is going on — much more than we do, at least. However, getting to her won't be easy. That asylum is like an impenetrable fortress, built to prevent anyone from both getting in and getting out.\"\n\nSunny lingered for a moment, and then added somberly:\n\n\"As for Mordret… well, he is probably the most well-guarded person in Mirage City. We don't know whether he remembers himself or not — all we know is that he is somehow connected to the Nihilist case. \"\n\nEffie raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Oh? Wait… before, the Devil Detective mentioned that he knew who the Nihilist was, and that he only needed concrete evidence to prove it. Don't tell me that he meant the most powerful person in the city?\"\n\nWhen Sunny remained silent, Effie's eyes widened.\n\n\"The young CEO of the Valor Group — Mordret, that creep — goes around gruesomely murdering people at night?\"\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n\"The Devil Detective was sure that it was Mordret… but I am not. He had a reason to hate that guy, though.\"\n\nFrowning, Sunny tried to parse through the vague, dreamlike memories of his counterpart. There were facts, there were emotions, there were thoughts and suspicions, all painted in dark hues by hatred, obsession, and insomnia.\n\nAfter a while, he explained:\n\n\"Everyone thinks that the Nihilist has never left any clues behind, but actually, that is not true. There was a piece of evidence at the first crime scene — a blood sample that did not belong to the victim. That DNA test revealed that it belonged to none other than the heir of Valor Group, Mordret.\"\n\nEffie arched her eyebrows.\n\n\"What? There was evidence connecting him to the crime scene? Why is he still walking free, then?\"\n\nSunny smiled bitterly.\n\n\"Because he had an ironclad alibi. There was video evidence proving that Mordret was on the other side of the city when the murder took place — so, the higher-ups chose to suppress the investigation. The blood sample was destroyed, and everyone who had come in contact with it was threatened into silence.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"The Devil Detective was the person in charge of the case, though, and he refused to let go. He believed that the video recording had been doctored, so the investigation into the Valor Group and its CEO continued with the Homicide Division Captain's silent approval.\"\n\nEffie looked at him in confusion.\n\n\"What happened next?\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, then said in an even tone:\n\n\"The Captain got into an unfortunate accident and passed away. My counterpart was convinced that she was killed because of the investigation and tried to accost Mordret, getting into an altercation with his security team. Needless to say, that was an unwise decision. The Nihilist had become a public menace by then, though, so they could not simply get rid of me. Instead, I was sent to a court-mandated psychological counseling and suspended pending a psychiatric evaluation.\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"And here we are.\"\n\nEffie considered his words for a while, then smiled faintly.\n\n\"So that is why you were so excited when those thugs pointed at the Valor Group. The identity of the latest victim gives us an excuse to dig into Mordret again.\"\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n\"Yes. They can bury a blood sample, but — ironically enough — they can't bury a corpse. Now that a person directly tied to Valor was killed by the Nihilist, we can openly investigate them — and nobody will be able to pressure us into giving up that lead without risking an avalanche of public outrage.\"\n\nEffie smiled.\n\n\"So… the first thing we need to do is figure out how exactly that Black Snake kid was connected to the Valor Group, right? That will give us an official reason to approach Mordret. And once we approach Mordret…\"\n\nSunny smiled darkly.\n\n\"We'll play it by ear. Oh, by the way, Morgan told me something else back when I saw her…\"\n\nHis smile turned cold all of a sudden.\n\n\"She told me that Mordret can actually be killed here.\"\n\nEffie raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"You're not planning to just assassinate him in broad daylight, are you?\"\n\nSunny lingered for a few moments, then shook his head with sigh of regret.\n\n\"No... that would probably be out of character for the Devil Detective.\"\n\nHe looked at Effie and smiled.\n\n\"It does sound tempting, though...\""

    "content": "2466 Changing the World\n\nThe Mirage City Center for Troubled Youths — a charitable organization set up by the Valor Group to help delinquent youths find their place in society — was situated some distance away from the ramshackle diner.\n\nSunny remembered how to properly fuel the Devil Detective's archaic PTV and stopped at a gas station, then checked his mental map of Mirage City аnd hesitantly plotted the course.\n\nAs they drove, the quaint vistas of the ancient city slowly ceased to look so odd. He was getting used to the odd architecture, the abundance of noisy PTVs, the lack of quarantine zones, and the flat nature of it all.\n\nThe people were the strangest, though, even if it took him a while to reаlize what that strangeness was…\n\nIt was the lack of fear.\n\nThe people of Mirage City all had their worries, of course, but their eyes lacked the subtle alertness that all humans of the waking world shared. A Nightmare Gate could open in front of them at any moment, after all; a Sleeper who had slipped through the cracks could turn into a Nightmare Creature and go on a rampage.\n\nThe humans of the waking world had grown accustomed to the constant threat of a sudden, senseless death and did not allow it to interfere with their lives. But that fear still left a mark on them.\n\nHere in Mirage City, though, there was no such threat. People were not immortal, but all the dangers they faced were mundane — they did not suffer the existential dread that the inhabitants of reality did, and were not ruled by a great and sinister power they were powerless against… the Nightmare Spell.\n\nSunny wondered what it would have felt like, to livе in a world that was free of the tyranny of Nightmares. To live without fear…\n\n'They would probably invent fears of their own, and live in a prison built of those.'\n\nEffie looked at him for a while, then asked in a lazy tone.\n\n\"Hey, partner. I've been thinking…'\n\nSunny suppressed a groan.\n\nThat didn't bode well.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\nEffie lingered for a moment, then shrugged with a grin.\n\n\"It's just that, wasn't this adventure supposed to prepare me for becoming a Sovereign? But instead, I ended up becoming mundane — three whole Ranks further away from Supremacy than I used to be. How come Kai gets to battle dreadful fallen deities, but I am stuck fistfighting third-rate thugs while dodging the advances of an Other who thinks that he's my husband? That's just… not fair!\"\n\nSunny gave her a sidelong glance. \"This adventure is indeed meant to help prepare you for the Fourth Nightmare. But Kai and you are different people. What you need to learn is different, too.\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Oh? And what is it that you think I must learn?\"\n\nHe exhaled slowly.\n\n\"Well, about that… actually, I am not too sure. You are a deceptive person, but in a different way from me.\"\n\nEffie stared at him in confusion for a while, then exploded with laughter.\n\n\"Me? A deceptive person? What are you talking about… I am an open book!\"\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"This is exactly what I am talking about. There are two of you, really — there is Effie… Raised By Wolves… a cheerful and easygoing woman who glides through life without taking anything too seriously. This is who everyone meets. But beneath it all, there is also Athena, Born From Being Eaten Alive, an astute and calloused person who had to fight desperately for each step she had taken in this world. This one, most people fail to see… but I know that she's there.\"\n\nEffie studied him for a few moments, then whistled and looked away.\n\n\"Wow. You are hopeless, you know that?\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"No, I don't. What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe chuckled.\n\n\"I mean, you just can't imagine that an astute person can be cheerful and easygoing, can you? Listen, you morose killjoy… you're entirely wrong. There is only one of me — I am not hiding behind a false facade of cheerfulness, I just know how to enjoy life, even if it seems too bitter to swallow at times.\"\n\nSunny smiled faintly.\n\n\"Too bitter to swallow… it's all food metaphors with you, huh?\"\n\nHe remained silent for a bit, then shrugged.\n\n\"Point is, Kai lacks confidence in himself. But you don't — on the contrary, you know exactly what you want, and you are not afraid to get it. In fact, I think that this is exactly the problem. You have already gotten everything you wanted… you've built the kind of life for yourself that leaves you entirely satisfied. So, you are not desperate enough.\"\n\nEffie raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Me? Not desperate enough? I feel desperate way too often, partner. Every time I look at my husband and at my son, I feel desperate to protect them — because I know all too well what is coming for all of us.\"\n\nHer voice had turnеd somber, losing its usual carefree tone for a short moment.\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"That is the thing, though. A Sovereign is someone who can reshape the world to fit their will — so, all Supremes are born from a desperate wish to change the world. Otherwise, where would their determination to reshape it come from? But you… you don't want to change the world. Rather, you want to make sure that the world maintains its shape, because it already fits you. You are the only person I know who is truly satisfied with their life, and that… I am not sure if that is enough.\"\n\nSunny was suddenly reminded of a conversation he had had with Effie a long time ago. He had shared his desire to be stronger than Nephis, and Effie told him that he would never be stronger than Nephis unless he found conviction. That was one of the reasons he had undertaken a perilous journey to Antarctica, in the end…\n\nWhat he was telling her now wasn't exactly the same, but he still couldn't help but feel that their roles were reversed.\n\nEffie remained silent for a while, then sighed.\n\n\"Is it such a sin, to be satisfied with one's life?\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"No, it's not. In fact, if you know some secret way to achieve that… please teach me!\"\n\nEffie laughed, then looked at him with a grin.\n\n\"Ah… so you want me to teach you about satisfaction. Okay, listen well — it's time for another one of Auntie Effie's lessons…\"\n\nSunny's eyes widened.\n\n'Oh, no...'\n\nHe suddenly realized that he was trapped in a PTV with her, with nowhere to escape."

    "title": "2467 A Troublesome Discovery.docx",
    "content": "2467 A Troublesome Discovery\n\nThe Center for Troubled Youths looked strangely tranquil and picturesque after the busy concrete jungle of the city. It was situated in a quiet neighborhood, taking up most of it — the grounds were surrounded by a neat fence, spacious enough to accommodate a modest park and a good collection of sports facilities, starting from a football field and ending with several tennis courts.\n\nThere were not a lot of the aforementioned troubled youths in sight, considering the pouring rain, but the buildings themselves looked clean and well-maintained. There was a main building where classes took place, two dormitories, a cafeteria hall, and so on… overall, the Youth Center looked like a campus of a prestigious, well-to-do university.\n\nThere was even a street musician on the corner, playing a peaceful tune on an old guitar while hiding under a large black umbrella.\n\nSunny and Effie looked at each other warily. After a while, he said:\n\n\"The more innocent it looks…\"\n\nEffie ended the sentence with a frown:\n\n\"The creepier it usually is.\"\n\nNeither of them liked the idea of the Valor Group and Mordret collecting young delinquents in an unassuming private facility — supposedly to help them. Who knew what kind of shady things were going on here?\n\nAfter hesitating for a while, Sunny sighed.\n\n\"You go talk to whoever is in charge here. I'll… look around.\"\n\nThey prеsented their badges to the security guard at the entrance and were admitted inside after some mild resistance. Effie headed for the main building to find the director of the Youth Center, while Sunny lingered at the gate for a while before leaving to explore the territory.\n\nThey met back at the car some time later, both wearing troubled expressions.\n\n\"What did you find?\"\n\nSunny's voice was even.\n\nEffie studied him for a bit, then said somberly.\n\n\"You first.\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"Well… it… seems completely normal?\"\n\nHer expression cleared.\n\n\"Right? I found absolutely nothing to suggest that there's something shady going on in this place. The director is a very nice old lady… she told me everything I needed to know, and was genuinely upset to learn that the kid had been killed.\"\n\nSunny scratched the back of his head.\n\n\"Right. I walked around the whole territory and even spoke to a few residents. Everything seems above board. The youths are content, well-cared for, and happy. There are no odd vibes, no creepy undertones… nothing suspicious at all. From everything I saw, it seems like a completely legitimate charitable organization that is both funded well and managed well, with everyone doing their hardest to make sure that these kids receive a bright future.\"\n\nThey stared at each other in utter confusion.\n\nWhy would Mordret run a real charity? And do so earnestly, voluntarily, and with no secret agenda to boot?\n\nSunny did not have shadow sense at the moment, while his other senses had been suppressed to the level of a mundane person. However, he still had his experience, instinct, and intuition — and yet, everything was telling him that there was nothing sinister or shady about the Center for Troubled Youths.\n\nEven the Devil Detective's dormant hostility could not find fault with this place.\n\nEffie scratched the back of her head.\n\n\"Very weird.\"\n\nSunny was inclined to agree. It was indeed extremely weird… but there was nothing they could do abоut it. In fact, why would they want to do something? It was odd to be unhappy that the youths weren't being exploited for nefarious purposes.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Anyway, did you find out anything?\"\n\nEffie remained silent for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"Oh… yes, sure. The victim was indeed a resident of this youth center at some point. However, he graduated successfully around a year ago. Many of these kids either get sponsored by the Valor Group and go on to receive higher education or are helped with seeking employment. The Valor Group has countless entry-level positions… so, most of the latter end up being employed internally.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"So, the victim was an employee of the Valor Group?\"\n\nEffie nodded.\n\n\"Indeed. In fact, he worked in its Corporate Security Branch… basically, he was a security guard. And not only that, he was posted in the Valor Group's main office.\"\n\nSunny's gaze grew sharper.\n\n\"Oh? Meaning…\"\n\nEffie grinned.\n\n\"Indeed. He had a chance to interact with Mordret on a daily basis. So if you wanted a reason to go and pay thаt bastard a visit… congratulations! Wishes do come true.\"\n\nSunny smiled darkly, then looked at the sky.\n\nThe sky was obscured by a thick layer of clouds, so he grimaced and lookеd at his watch instead.\n\nThen, he cursed quietly.\n\n\"Hey… how the hell do I read time from an analogue watch?\"\n\nEffie blinked a couple of times.\n\n\"What's an analogue watch?\"\n\nIt took them a couple of minutes to figure out the barbaric technology of the bygone era. Determining that it was already evening, Sunny sighed. \"I don't think we'll be able to catch Mordret at work at the moment. So… let's pay him a visit tomorrow morning?\"\n\nEffie shrugged.\n\n\"Sure. So… arе we clocking out, then?\"\n\nHer voice was lacking enthusiasm, which prompted Sunny to give her a long look.\n\n\"If you don't want to go home, you can crash at my place. Granted, the Devil Detective was not the cleanest of people… but since I doubt that you'll be scared away by a little mess, it should be fine.\"\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"Is that your way of calling me a slob? In any case… thanks, but no thanks. I don't think that abandoning her children and spending the night at a odd man's place would be in character for my counterpart. So, I'll head home…\"\n\nShe looked around, then added sheepishly:\n\n\"Or rather, I'll trouble you to drive me home, partner. I barely figured out how to get to the crime scene after receiving the call — now, I am completely turned around.\"\n\nSunny sighed and unblocked the archaic PTV.\n\n\"Sure, no problem. Get in… partner.\""

    "title": "2468 Home Bitter Home.docx",
    "content": "2468 Home Bitter Home\n\nIt was already late when Sunny returned to his dark, dusty apartment. Unlocking the door, he walked inside, closed it, then gave it a long look.\n\n'How fun.'\n\nThe door was made from a sheet of ordinary metal, while the walls around it were nothing but concrete panels. In other words, even a Dormant Nightmare Creature could easily rip through the door or crash through the walls… but then again, there were no abominations in this world. So, these pitiful safety measures could very well stop anyone uninvited from entering the apartment.\n\nThat said, the Devil Detective was a paranoid guy — and for a good reason. As a cop, he had a lot of enemies, and his nasty temperament did not earn him any friends either. So, one of the empty bottles scattered around the apartment actually served a purpose.\n\nFollowing a habit that belonged to someone else, Sunny locked the door and carefully balanced the bottle on its handle. That way, if someone picked the locks and tried to enter quietly in the middle of the night, the bottle was going to fall and break loudly, alerting him to the presence of an intruder.\n\nSunny was usually guarded by one of the shadows, so this level of caution felt both unfamiliar and new.\n\nTurning away from the door, he studied his place of residence.\n\nDust everywhere, empty bottles and plastic food containers scattered on the floor, oil stains and streaks оn every glass surface…\n\nWith a sigh, Sunny removed the bottle from the door handle and opened the curtains. Then, he rolled up his sleeves and got to cleaning.\n\nAn hour or two later, after a few visits to the nearby trash containers, the apartment finally started to resemble a place suitable for human life. Locking the door once more, Sunny lowered himself into a threadbare armchair and let out a heavy sigh.\n\nIt was ridiculous to admit, but this little amount of physical activity had tired him out. His muscles ached… not from battling some awful Nightmare Creature, but from fighting mundane thugs and dust!\n\n'Such an… indignity…'\n\nHe was sleepy.\n\nBefore dragging his tired body to the bed, however, Sunny took the primitive communicator out of his pocket, struggled against the unfamiliar interface for a while, and finally managed to dial the number Saint had given him.\n\nFor a few moments, odd noises poured into his ear. Then, the enthralling voice of his supposed therapist resounded from the communicator, making Sunny shiver against his will.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nHe lingered for a few moments, then spoke in a neutral tone.\n\n\"Dr. Saint, good evening. This is… Detective Sunless from Mirage PD. I wanted to discuss future therapy sessions…\"\n\nA few minutes later, he put down the communicator and closed his eyes. The echoes of Saint's voice were still resounding in his ears.\n\n'This is so strange. To hear her talk.'\n\nBefore Sunny knew it, he fell into the soft embrace of sleep.\n\n…In a different part of Mirage City, earlier, Effie had spent a long time standing in front of the door of a small, cozy villa. Eventually, she took a deep breath, put on a bright smile, and walked in.\n\n\"Mooommy!\"\n\n\"Mama!\"\n\nTwo energetic kids rushed to her, their faces shining with happiness and adoration. Effie leaned down to catch them, then lifted them into the air, feeling little arms wrap around her neck and kisses being planted on her cheeks.\n\n\"Mommy is home!\"\n\n\"Mama! Mama!\"\n\nFailing to resist the overflowing cuteness, Effie nuzzled the children. Her forced smile gradually turned into a natural one.\n\n\"Oh, my! Who are these little darlings? Are you my kids? No way! My precious children were way smaller when I left home… how did you grow up this much in just a day? Huh? If this continues, you'll be carrying mommy instead by the end of the week…\"\n\nThe children giggled as he brought them into the living room.\n\n\"Noooo…\"\n\nEffie let the babysitter go, then got busy caring for the children herself. She prepared them food with unfamiliar ingredients, read them unfamiliar books, played unfamiliar games with them, and helped them wash in an unfamiliar bathroom.\n\nHer counterpart's children were younger than her dumpling was… he had grown up too fast, which left her feeling wistful. So, spending time with these little cuties lifted her mood.\n\nOf course, they weren't children at all. The cute little boy and the adorable little girl who called her mommy were the Others… the terrifying, unfathomable beings forced into the shape of children by the Great Mirror.\n\nBut they looked so real, and acted so real… more than that, her counterpart's dreamlike memories were still flowing like a hazy river in her mind — memories full of real love and affection for these tiny bundles of joy and innocence, just like she was full of fierce love and аffection for her own.\n\nIt was a maddening contradiction, to find herself caring for little children who treated her like their mother, but were not hers… children who were innocent and pure, but at the same time monstrous and frightening. Effie could feel herself reeling.\n\nBut despite all that, and even knowing better…\n\nShe simply could not bring herself to treat them like monsters. Perhaps it was the mother in her, but the sight of the childlike smiles made her heart both flutter and ache.\n\n'Ah. What am I going to do…'\n\nAt some point, her counterpart's husband returned from work.\n\nHe was tall, he was handsome, he was gentle and sweet…\n\nBut he wasn't her husband. He was not the man she loved — his features were different, his voice was different, his smile was different… and for that reason, everything about him was hateful.\n\nThe kids were asleep, and now, it was time for her and her supposed husband to go to bed, too.\n\nHowever, Effie was not having it.\n\n\"Here. You go sleep on the couch.\"\n\nShe handed the startled man a rolled-up blanket and a pillow.\n\nHe looked at her with eyes full of confusion.\n\n\"Uh… darling? W—what did I do?\"\n\nEffie smiled.\n\nIndeed, what did the poor guy do? She couldn't really tell him that there was only one man allowed into her bed — her husband — and that he was not that man… that he was not even a man. He was an Other pretending to be one.\n\nSo, Effie employed a tactic tried and tested by numerous generations of women.\n\nGiving the Other Husband an offended look, she said in a wrathful tone:\n\n\"You have the gall to ask? Wow… just wow. Go figure it out! You'll be sleeping on the couch until you do!\"\n\nThe man paled.\n\n\"B—but, darling…\"\n\nNot hearing any objections, she pushed him out of the bedroom and slammed the door shut.\n\nFinally alone, Effie let out a relieved sigh.\n\nLooking at her empty bed, she then sighed again.\n\n\"Damn, was I swindled? I really can't see how any of this will help me become Supreme... ah, I want to go home...\""

    "content": "2469 World of Abundance\n\nThe next morning, Sunny parked his PTV in front of Effie's home in a foul mood. She was standing there with a brown paper bag in her hand, holding the umbrella with the other and yawning. When he opened the door, she climbed in and gave him a reproachful look.\n\n\"You're late.\"\n\nSunny cursed under his breath.\n\n\"Do you know what I had to do on the way here?\"\n\nEffie shrugged.\n\n\"No idea. Why?\"\n\nSunny gave the steering wheel of the PTV an annoyed push.\n\n\"I had to refuel this piece of junk! Again!\"\n\nShe stared at him in shock.\n\n\"What? No way. These things need to be refueled daily?\"\n\nHe nodded a few times.\n\n\"That's what I'm saying! That pungent, flammable fuel? Turns out, they burn through it faster than I burn through essence!\"\n\nEffie blinked a couple of times, then shook her head and put on her seatbelt.\n\n\"No, but really... daily? What a hassle.\"\n\nSunny was inclined to agree.\n\nAs they drove to their destination, Effie explained what she managed to salvage from her counterpart's memory last evening. Most of it had to do with police procedures and protocols they had to follow — paperwork, briefing the press, coordinating with other teams, and so on.\n\n\"Actually, I already received a phone call from the Captain. There is going to be a press conference tomorrow afternoon, where I am supposed to make a statement to answеr a few questions. The journalists are dying to know about the Nihilist and his latest victim — obviously, they are also dying to castigate the Police Department and lament the lack of progress in catching him. I'm the designated punching bag, I guess.\"\n\nSunny smiled faintly.\n\n\"That should be nothing new for you, though? You've been the propaganda machine's favorite ever since the Forgotten Shore. Remember those posters of you they plastered all around NQSC? The first batch, I mean…\"\n\nEffie stared at him for a few moments, then laughed.\n\n\"Oh, gods! You saw those? Wow… made an impression, did I?\"\n\nWell, her armor certainly did...\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"Some of them took entire facades of huge buildings. You were hard to miss.\"\n\nShe grinned and looked into the window, at the colorful billboards decorating the buildings of Mirage City. They were propaganda posters, as well… only of a different, far more subtle kind. Instead of the government pushing a false narrative onto its citizens to control the population, these were made by private enterprises to manipulate people into consuming their goods.\n\nIt was hard to tell which was more invasive. \"It is both wonderful and sinister, don't you think?\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nShe pointed to the city outside the window.\n\n\"This world… a world of abundance. Of prosperity so extreme and staggering that it has become a problem in and of itself. A world that is based on endless growth, and therefore can never allow itself to slow down — even a little, even for a brief moment, no matter if there is still a reason to rush forward or not.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a few moments, then shrugged.\n\n\"To be honest, I am not very familiar with how the world was before the Dark Times. I only know the romantic version of it — the great golden age of humanity before all the problems started, and all that. A lost era of peace and prosperity. People usually talk about this time as some kind of a lost paradise.\"\n\nEffie smiled.\n\n\"I guess it was, for a while. As close to a paradise as we have ever come.\"\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\"Of course, the construction of that paradise was financed by borrowing from thе future, which ended up causing all those problems to begin with, when the time to pay up arrived. Still… I like it here.\"\n\nShe opened her paper bag and pulled out a small carton painted in brown and white.\n\n\"Do you know what this is?\"\n\nSunny almost flinched. That tone, that glint in her eyes — he knew it all too well! It was the look of insatiable avarice and utter obsession… which Sunny himself wore when looking at soul shards and piles of treasure.\n\n'What is she...'\n\nEffie drew in a shaky breath.\n\n\"This… this just might be the greatest invention humanity has ever made. It is called... chocolate milk! This era has it, but ours doesn't, so how can I be critical of the past? The world has really gone to crap since then...\"\n\nOpening the carton, she took a big sip and leaned back with a blissful smile.\n\n\"Aaahhh…\"\n\nSunny gave her a dubious look.\n\n\"Did you, by any chance, steal this from your kids?\"\n\nEffie gave him a look of outrage.\n\n\"What? Of course not! I just… they still have apple juice, okay?\"\n\nSunny shook his head reproachfully.\n\n\"Uh-huh. Well, do you at least have another carton so I could try it, too?\"\n\nEffie brought the paper back closer to her chest, looking at him defensively.\n\n\"N—no?\"\n\nHe looked at her in indignation.\n\n\"Wаit, you didn't just go on and on singing praises tо this chocolate milk of yours without planning to share it with your senior, did you?\"\n\nEffie stared at him with an open mouth for а while.\n\n\"Listen, senior. I'm a growing girl…\"\n\nSunny almost choked.\n\n\"A growing girl? Where are you planning to grow?! If you grow any more, your head will punch through the roof!\"\n\nEffie grinned.\n\n\"What, jealous?\"\n\nInstead of answering, Sunny snatched her paper bag.\n\n\"Hey! Give it back!\"\n\n…The car swayed slightly, continuing on its way.\n\nSoon enough, they reached the headquarters of the Valor Group. The building was hard to miss — it was almost the same height as the dormitory hives in NQSC, towering above the landscape like a glass spire. It was impossible to see it tip when standing on the ground below, no matter how much one craned their neck, and trying was enough to make one's head spin.\n\nEffie whistled.\n\n\"You know, the Valor Group used to have its main offices in a different skyscraper, which was the tallest building in Mirage City. But then, a different conglomerate built one that was even taller. And then a third conglomerate built one even taller than that… until the Valor Group built this one, which is the current tallest.\"\n\nShe grinned.\n\n\"These guys really like to measure whose tower is the biggest, huh? I wonder what can be behind their obsession with tower sizes…\"\n\nSunny stared at the glass skyscraper for a few moments.\n\n\"I'm not really interested in their tower-measuring contests. By the way… what does the Valor Group even do? I mean, what's their business?\"\n\nEffie scratched her head.\n\n\"Everything is their business. Your communicator? They made it. You PTV? They built it. Your apartment complex? They both built it and own it. Your furniture, your clothes, your food… your cops, your politicians — anything you point at in Mirage City, chances are, it exists because of the Valor Group.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a while.\n\n'How bizarre.'\n\nThen, he looked at her and smiled.\n\n\"So… let's go take the CEO of the Valor Group down, shall we?\"\n\nEffie chuckled.\n\n\"I thought you'd never ask…\""

    "content": "2470 Glass Spire\n\nThe lobby of the Valor Tower was as glamorous and quietly oppressive as its exterior — so much so that Sunny and Effie, the only two people not wearing smart business suits here, looked woefully out of place.\n\nEffie was stunning enough to turn heads, but her lackadaisical athleisure ensemble seemed too casual and slopρy… as for Sunny, his cheap, nondescript cop clоthes looked outright shabby and inappropriate in this grandiose temple to money and power.\n\nNevertheless, both carried themselves with absolute confidence, as if they owned the place, which only brought them more attention.\n\n'Here we go.'\n\nWalking over to the vast reception desk, Sunny showed his badge to the nearest receptionist.\n\n\"Detective Sunless and Detective Athena of Mirage PD. We are here to meet Mr. Mordret.\"\n\nThe young woman looked between the two of them with a lost expression — at least for a moment. Then, her training kicked in. Her expression instantly changed to that of an extremely polite brick wall, and she said with a flawlessly neutral smile:\n\n\"Oh… oh, I see. Do you have an appointment?\"\n\nSunny mentally translated her words…\n\n'No chance in hell. Be gone, peasants!'\n\nOf course, not just anybody could meet the CEO of the Valor Group. In fact, very few people could, and a couple of lowly detectives were definitely not in that small, exceedingly elite club.\n\nHe responded to the receptionist's smile with one of her own.\n\n\"No. Do you have hearing loss?\"\n\nShe blinked.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nEffie leaned on the desk languidly.\n\n\"My partner was wondering which part of what he had said you failed to hear. Was it 'detective' or 'Mirage PD'? Or do you just think that police officers have nothing to do all day and would seek out your CEO without a reason? We have an important and official reason to see him, so hurry up and get him into a room with us.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow and waved his badge in the air.\n\n\"Or are you blind? Did you perhaps not see our identification?\"\n\nThe receptionist maintained her professional smile.\n\n\"I am not sure I...\"\n\nEffie shook her head and said loudly:\n\n\"Wait, no. They wouldn't keep a deaf, blind girl at the reception — that'd just be cruel. Perhaps they simply don't care that the Nihilist is walking around killing people.\"\n\nBy then, they were already being slowly surrounded by security guards, who weren't even trying to be subtle about it.\n\nSunny sighed, and then added in a similarly loud tone:\n\n\"Killing people, including their own colleagues! My, what a shame… it seems that the Valor Group treats police officers with contempt and is refusing to help the investigation. Are they just callous, or do they have something to hide? Goodness gracious, what a sad turn of events…\"\n\nHe felt a little guilty about putting the poor receptionist on the spot. Gods knew she was probably just hoping to get through the day… but at the same time, she was guarding the gates of hell, so a bit of torment came with the territory.\n\nThe security guards had surrounded him and Effie by that point, looking at each other with troubled expressions. The loud voices had also gathered a small crowd… if office workers were known for one thing, it was that they often suffered from boredom. So, they were not going to miss a bit of drama to fuel the gossip.\n\nThat was what Sunny wanted. He knew, of course, that getting to Mordret was not going to be simple — in fact, it was all but impossible in the short term.\n\nEven if an employee of the Valor Group had been killed by the Nihilist, that did not mean that they could just go and interrogate the CEO… they would have to go through a chain of increasingly important people first, starting from some poor exec and working their way upward from there.\n\nSo, he was fully prepared for that long and arduous process. Making a scene in the lobby was merely the first step — the threat of a public disturbance would force someone in the hierarchy of the Valor Group to appease them, which was going to be a start.\n\nEffie sighed and reached into her paper bag to produce a sandwich. Unwrapping it slowly, she said:\n\n\"Well, what can we do? I guess I won't have anything to tell the press tomorrow… just that our attempts at cooperation with the Valor Group were, sadly, met with a pronounced lack of enthusiasm. It just breaks my heart to imagine what people will say the next time the Nihilist strikes… could it have been prevented? Could the Valor Group have helped? I guess we'll never know…\"\n\nThe receptionist paled a little, then exchanged a series of glances with a senior colleague. Finally, she smiled weakly.\n\n\"Oh, no… I'm afraid you misunderstood, detectives. Let me contact a superior and see what I can do. Please make yourself comfortable! Would you like a cup of coffee?\"\n\nSunny once again translated her words:\n\n'Shut up and stop making a scene, bastards! Go sit in a corner like good children while we find a scapegoat to entertain you for a bit!'\n\nAt the same time, an avalanche of phone calls would probably descend on the Homicide Division Captain, who would get screamed at by half a dozen people to remind him to keep his subordinates under control.\n\nSunny glanced at the nervous security guards, then at the receptionist.\n\nEventually, he shrugged.\n\n\"I don't want coffee. Do you have chocolate milk?\"\n\nThe receptionist gave him a very odd look.\n\n\"Wha... I'm not sure?\"\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"Then that won't do…\"\n\nBut before he could continue to apply pressure to hopefully get a more important scapegoat, and therefore shave off a couple of steps to the unreachable, deific CEO of the all-powerful Valor Group, a pleasant voice suddenly resounded from behind.\n\n\"Excuse me. Perhaps I can help?\"\n\nSunny froze.\n\nEffie did, too.\n\nThey glanced at each other tensely, then slowly turned around.\n\nBehind them, a striking man in an immaculately tailored, slightly flamboyant yet elegant suit was standing in a circle of bodyguards.\n\nHe seemed to be around thirty, tall and in perfect shape, with pale skin and raven-black hair. His face was on the sharper side… not exactly handsome, but at the same time charming and strangely beautiful. Everything about him screamed of wealth and class — the emerald fabric of his bespoke suit, the subtle splendor of his luxury watch, the precious gemstones on his cufflinks and tie pin…\n\nBut more than wealth, the man emanated the feeling of power.\n\nIt was a different kind of presence from the oppressive aura his father used to possess. Instead, the man seemed friendly and mild. And yet, anyone could tell that he was someone extraordinary simply because of how absolutely relaxed and at ease he seemed — as if nothing in the world could possibly pose a problem to him.\n\nHis tie was loose, and a few buttons of his designer shirt were stylishly missing. There was an easy, relaxed smile on his face, and a spark of curiosity in his strange eyes… his eyes that resembled two pools of liquid silver, reflecting the world back on itself.\n\nNoticing their strange expressions, the man blinked a few times.\n\n\"Oh, where are my manners? Allow me to introduce myself…\"\n\nBut of course, the man needed no introduction.\n\nHe was the young CEO of the Valor Group…\n\nMordret."

    "title": "2471 A Happy Family.docx",
    "content": "2471 A Happy Family\n\nThe young heir of the Valor Group seemed friendly and easygoing — charming, even, with his elegant manners and disarming smile. And yet, Sunny and Effie saw subtle signs of tension and wariness reflected back to them from his mirror-like eyes.\n\nTension and wariness written on their own faces.\n\nHow could they not be alarmed? This was Mordret, the Prince of Nothing… a man who was no different from a wicked demon, only more sinister by far. Sure, Sunny had foiled Mordret's plans repeatedly, but that did not make the mirror wraith any less threatening.\n\nThe remains of the House of Night could attest to that.\n\nFrom the mild and innocent look in the Valor Group CEO's eyes, though, he did not seem to remember his true self. But then again, this was Mordret they were talking about — the man was more adept in deception and acting than even Sunny himself was. Had he truly forgotten who he was, or was he merely pretending?\n\nThere was no way to tell.\n\nSunny and Effie glanced at each other. Then, he spoke with a neutral expression:\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Mordret. I am Detective Sunless, and this is Detective Athena from the Homicide Division of the Mirage City Police. We were hoping to speak to you regarding an ongoing investigation.\"\n\nMordret studied them for a moment.\n\n\"Well, in that case, why don't we speak in my office? If there is anything I can do to help you catch that terrible man, naturally, I must help.\"\n\nSunny blinked.\n\n'That easy? What is he playing at?'\n\nAt that moment, one of the bodyguards whispered something in Mordret's ear. Mordret glanced at Sunny, then shrugged with a faint smile.\n\n\"Oh, I am sure that Detective Sunless had his reasons. There must have been some misunderstanding.\"\n\nWith that, he gestured to the elevators.\n\n\"Please, follow me.\"\n\nSunny and Effie followed him, only to find out that there was a separate, far more luxurious elevator that seemed to be accessible only to the CEO. As they ascended the impressive length of the Valor Tower, Mordret's bodyguards were drilling holes in their backs with hostile stares — their employer, meanwhile, seemed perfectly at ease.\n\n\"Detective Athena… I am quite sorry to presume, but have we met before? You seem familiar.\"\n\nSunny frowned, wondering if that was Mordret's way of hinting that he remembered them. Effie forced out a smile.\n\n\"I really don't think so. Where would a humble public servant like me meet the illustrious CEO of the Valor Group?\"\n\nMordret lingered a little bit, then suddenly beamed.\n\n\"Athena… oh! Why, of course. Weren't you a national athlete? You really made us proud! I still remember the spear throw that won you the first golden medal… it was such a marvelous sight. I can't believe I get to meet you!\"\n\nEffie coughed.\n\n\"Oh, that… right. That was so many years ago, though. I'm surprised you remember.\"\n\nMordret smiled.\n\n\"Our family is very passionate about sports. A representative of Mirage City bringing home a whole collection of medals — how could I ever forget?\"\n\n'What the hell is going on?'\n\nSunny suddenly felt out of place. Why was hе riding an elevator with Mordret, and why was Mordet fanboying over meeting Effie? What kind of bizarreness was this?\n\nSoon enough, they arrived in a lavish office that took up most of the uppermost floor of the Valor Tower. The walls were made out of armored glass, so one could see most of Mirage City from here, sprawled far below and stretching toward the horizon. The people populating it looked like ants from the height… and perhaps that was what they were for someone as powerful as the CEO of the Valor Group.\n\nThe most stunning thing in Mordret's office was not the view, though, and not the unimaginably expensive decor either. Rather, it was a large framed photo hanging on the wall like a cherished art piece.\n\nOn it, a smiling man and a beautiful woman were looking into the camera, embracing a sullen teenage boy and an adorable girl with black locks. There were a few other people there, as well, all surrounded by a happy and affectionate atmosphere.\n\nSunny recognized them, of course — they were the Valor family, both those whom he met and those who had perished many years ago.\n\nThe teenage boy and the younger girl were Mordret and Morgan. The beautiful woman was Gwyn of Valor… the smiling man was Anvil.\n\nSunny stared at the photo with wide eyes.\n\nNever in his wildest dreams had he imagined that he would see the King of Swords smiling happily one day.\n\n'What the...'\n\nNoticing his gaze, Mordret smiled as well.\n\n\"Not as scary as people say, are we?\"\n\nHe chuckled and pointed at a dignified old man standing behind the smiling pair.\n\n\"This is my grandfather, the founder of the Valor Group — an outstanding engineer and a man of keen business acumen. Everything around us exists because of his hard work and leadership. He is retired now, of course, spending his days tinkering with old machines and pestering his grandkids to hurry up and produce newer models — great grandkids, I mean — for him to boss around. \"\n\nSunny looked at the old man.\n\n'Warden of Valor…'\n\nMordret, meanwhile, pointed to the happy couple.\n\n\"You must be familiar with my parents. As much as the Valor Group only exists because of grandpa, it became what it is today thanks to my father. Oh, they mostly devote themselves to traveling and charitable work these days… really, mom and dad hatched a plan to escape into early retirement as soon as I was old enough to become the CEO. How heartless!\"\n\nMordret chuckled again, then glanced at the little girl in the photo and fell silent for a moment. Then, he smiled pleasantly and gestured to an opulent sofa.\n\n\"Please, take a seat. Your… chocolate milk?... will be here in a moment.\"\n\nSunny and Effie glanced at each other.\n\n'What the hell is this?'\n\nWarden of Valor had perished in the Third Nightmare. Gwyn died in childbirth when Mordret was around two. Anvil was slain by Sunny in Godgrave… where did this vision of a happy family come from?\n\nWhy had the Palace of Imagination created this fantasy foг Mordret?\n\nAnd why was Mordret acting as if it was the most natural thing in the world? He hated his family… his hatred of Valor was so scathing and deep that a whole Great Clan had been callously used as kindling to fuel his vengеance.\n\nDid he… really not remember anything?\n\nEven if he didn't, wasn't this persona too big of a departure from his true self? The Devil Detective and his rookie partner were not Sunny and Effie, true, but they were similar people.\n\nThis version of Mordret, though, seemed… eerily well-adjusted and harmless. Not like his true self at all.\n\nAs they sat down, Mordret lowered himself into a chair and asked in a pleasant tone:\n\n\"So, what did you want to discuss?\"\n\nSunny lingered for a few moments, then said in a measured tone:\n\n\"We wanted to discuss the Nihilist.\"\n\nHe watched Mordret closely, hoping to see a reaction.\n\nHowever, Mordret did not react in any paгticular way… as if there was no connection between him and the deranged serial killer at all.\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n'But there is. There definitely is... Is there?'"

    "content": "2472 Presumption of Innocence\n\nMordret showed no reaction to Sunny mentioning the Nihilist — outside of how a nоrmal person would react, that was. Unease, discomfort, and a hint of indignation showed on his face, but nothing more.\n\nIf he was acting, the man deserved to be a lead performer in a renowned theater.\n\nBut then again, that was exactly what Mordret was capable of.\n\nHe sighed and shook his head.\n\n\"I see. I heard there was a new victim?\"\n\nEffie nodded.\n\n\"Indeed. The body was discovered yesterday, in a park by the river.\"\n\nMordret seemed saddened by the news, but also a little curious.\n\n\"How very tragic. However, detectives… I wonder why you deemed it necessary to speak to me, of all people?\"\n\nHis expression was full of innocent confusion.\n\nSunny cleared his throаt.\n\n\"Well, you see, the victim was an employee of yours. A graduate of one of the Valor Group's charities and a security guard right here in this building.\"\n\nHearing the name, Mordret seemed genuinely shocked.\n\n\"That young man? But… but I greeted him only two days ago.\"\n\nSunny nodded solemnly.\n\n\"I'm afraid so. Did you interact with him often?\"\n\nBefore Mordret could answer, one of his people leaned in and whispered something into his ear. He frowned, and a hint of anger suddenly flashed in his mirror-like eyes.\n\n\"...Why would I need to have a lawyer present? What nonsense!\"\n\nHe sent the man away and turned to Sunny and Effie with an awkward expression.\n\n\"I'm sorry. My employees can be... overzealous, at times. Obviously, the Valor Group will help the investigation in any way we can — just tell me what you need, detectives.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a while. He was starting to become convinced that Mordret had not regained his memories… but even then, that did not absolve him of being the Nihilist.\n\nIt was hard to imagine this pleasant, affable, sleek and polished man stalking the streets of Mirage City at night to carve out people's eyes.\n\nThere was no madness in his own eyes, no murderous intent… more than that, there was no killing instinct in them whatsoever. Sunny was a killer himself, so he knew killers well — despite that, his senses told him that the CEO of the Valour Group was nothing but soft, pampered by life, and harmless.\n\nBut then again, he had been fooled by Mordret before.\n\nHe could even imagine a number of bizarre scenarios… the memories of the real Mordret only awakening at night, for example, then disappearing when the moon vanished behind the horizon, so that the man woke up genuinely unaware of what his true self did while he slept. Who said that such nonsense was impossible?\n\nSunny hesitated a little, then decided to stop wasting time.\n\n\"Well… first, it would really help us to know where you were on the night of the murder.\"\n\nMordret looked at him in confusion for a few moments, then opened his eyes wide in disbelief.\n\n\"Am… I a suspect?\"\n\nSunny shrugged.\n\n\"Sure. Why not?\"\n\nMordret studied him for a bit, then suddenly exploded with laughter.\n\n\"I'm… I'm sorry! I know that this is no laughing matter, but me? Me, going around killing people? What a ridiculous notion.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"What reason would I have to do something that ghastly, detective?\"\n\nSunny met his amused gaze, with not a hint of nervousness in it, and sighed.\n\n\"Well, to be honest, we haven't quite figured out such a reason yet.\"\n\nMordret raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"I see. Then, perhaps, a better question would be — what reason do you have to suspect me?\"\n\nHe seemed genuinely curious.\n\nSunny and Effie exchanged a glance. Then, she leaned forward a little.\n\n\"Do you really not know, or are you just pretending not to know?\"\n\nMordret blinked a few times.\n\n\"Know what?\"\n\nEffie clicked her tongue.\n\n\"About the evidence found on the first crime scene, naturally. Just a few drops of blood that did not belong to the victim… instead, Mr. Mordret, it belonged to you. The DNA test confirmed it.\"\n\nHe looked at her with an utterly lost expression.\n\n\"My blood was discovered at a crime scene? Surely, you jest, Detective Athena.\"\n\nSunny frowned, dismayed that there was still not the slightest indication that Mordret was lying to them.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell us that you had no idea about that DNA sample? I find it hard to believe, considering how persistently we were forbidden from pursuing that avenue of investigation. Somebody knew, and somebody gave an order to suppress the investigation. Oh… was that done by those overzealous employees of yours without your order, as well?\"\n\nMordret remained silent for a while, the amused expression slowly draining from his face. Eventually, he looked at his subordinates scornfully.\n\n\"...I understand you find it hard to believe, detective, but I really had no idea that such a DNA sample existed before you told me. Still… if memory serves, I was at a very public charity dinner on the night the Nihilist claimed his first victim. There should be plenty of video recordings showing me mingling with the guests.\"\n\nSunny smiled darkly. \"Video recordings can be doctored.\"\n\nMordret looked at him with curiosity.\n\n\"And I guess witness testimonies can be bought off? But, detective, there is a flaw in your logic. Wouldn't it be much easier for someone to plant my DNA at a crime scene?\"\n\nSunny glared at him for a few moments, then admitted reluctantly:\n\n\"Sure. A few drops of blood could have been planted. But who would go that far to frame you?\"\n\nMordret remained silent before letting out a bitter sigh and looking away.\n\n\"I have countless enemies, detectives. Sadly, that comes with the job.\"\n\nIt did not escape Sunny's attention that Mordret looked at the family photo while saying that.\n\nSo… there was trouble in paradise, after all.\n\nSunny leaned forward a little.\n\n\"Anyone in particular come to mind?\"\n\nThen, he added with a faint smile:\n\n\"How is your sister doing, by the way?\"\n\nFor the first time, Mordret's expression showed a sign of cracking.\n\nWhat was revealed behind the pleasant smile was not the heartless malevolence of his true self, however. Instead, it was… pain? Sorrow? Confusion?\n\nMordret froze for a few moments, then leaned back and looked at Sunny with a cold expression.\n\n\"My sister can't be behind this. She… has suffered a psychotic break a while back.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"A psychotic break?\"\n\nMordret nodded slowly.\n\n\"She… might have… tried to harm me, in her compromised state. She is now receiving treatment in a reputable establishment — she hardly could have done anything from there.\"\n\n'Did Morgan try to kill Mordret?'\n\nThat would surely make a lot of sense, considering what she had told him.\n\nSunny summed up what they had learned.\n\nThe Great Mirror version of Mordret seemed to have no memories of his true self. There was no concrete evidence connecting him to the murders, and the man himself seemed eerily innocent. Clan Valor was one big, loving family in this fantastical realm, and Morgan had tried to kill her brother some time ago, which landed her in a psychiatric hospital…\n\nFor her own good, if Mordret was to be believed.\n\n'Damn it. I think I understand even less now.'\n\nMorgan… Morgan had all the answers, it seemed.\n\nSunny looked at the family portrait of the Valor family with a dark expression.\n\n\"We might have a talk with your sister, then.\"\n\nMordret's expression changed.\n\n\"Absolutely not. Under no circumstances will you — or anyone else — disturb my sister. She doesn't need more shock and trauma to distract her from healing.\"\n\nHis voice sounded cold and absolute, showing the harrowing authority of the ruler of the Valor Group for the first time.\n\nSunny wanted to respond, but at that moment, Effie leaned forward and put a hand on Mordret's shoulder.\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"Hey. Mordret… snap out of it.\"\n\n'What is she doing?!'\n\nSunny's eyes widened slightly, and so did Mordret's.\n\nFor a few moments, the luxurious office was silent.\n\nThen, something changed in Mordret's gaze.\n\nHe suddenly seemed…\n\nConfused, and a little bit embarrassed?\n\nTaking Effie's hand gently, he awkwardly removed it from his shoulder and asked in a hesitant tone:\n\n\"Excuse me, Detective Athena? Snap out of what?\"\n\nEffie frowned, then retracted her arm and cleared her throat.\n\n\"That… uh… just saying. Never mind.\"\n\nShe looked at Sunny and raised an eyebrow.\n\nWhatever authority she had as the master of Bastion did not seem to have affected Mordret at all. He was still blissfully devoid of any memories... allegedly.\n\nHe was also quite keen on seeing them off now.\n\nA charming smile returned to his face.\n\n\"As I've said, I'll be glad to help the investigation in any way I can. We can request the personal file of the unfortunate victim from the Human Resources… security footage of his latest shift can also be arranged. I'm afraid I will have to hand you over to my assistants now, detective — please excuse me, but my schedule today is quite full.\"\n\nJust like that, the meeting was over. Before too long, Sunny and Effie found themselves standing in front of the Valor Tower, looking at it with grim expressions.\n\nEffie sighed.\n\n\"Well. That was…\"\n\nBut before she could finish, Sunny's communication went off.\n\nHe took it out of his pocket, looked at it darkly, and pressed the green button to receive the call.\n\nA second later — and for a while longer — the Homicide Division Captain's angry screams could be heard flying out of the flimsy speaker.\n\nSunny took a deep breath.\n\n'Damnation...'"

The cause of death this time was severe spinal trauma — his neck had been broken. It was unclear whether the eyes had been removed before or after his death, but it had been done with surgical precision.\n\n'Such a hassle.'\n\nAfter dealing with these routine tasks, Sunny returned home late in the evening.\n\n…This time, he remembered to power down his archaic PTV before walking away from it. As it turned out, these strange machines had no standby mode and had to be turned off completely every time.\n\n'How primitive. My Rhino would never…'\n\nEntering the apartment, he balanced the bottle on the door handle and sighed.\n\nTurning on the TV — a primitive kind of entertainment center — to hear what was being said on the news, Sunny opened the closet and removed all the clothes from the hangers. Behind thеm, a seemingly chaotic mess of photos and printed documents was revealed, pinned to a large map of Mirage City and connected by red strings.\n\nThe Devil Detective had never stopped working the Nihilist case, even if he had been suspended. The photos belonged to the victims of the serial killer, as well as to various persons of interest. The printed documents contained details about their identities, the crime scenes, and the autopsies. The red strings tied it all together… not the Strings of Fate tiеd all of existence together.\n\nIt was just that Sunny could not see the pattern that connected all these seemingly disjointed events in the red weave.\n\nHe could not see it yet…\n\nThe news came and went, containing no useful information at all. There was a lot of fearmongering concerning the Nihilist, as well as a few puff pieces about the Valor Group and its latest initiatives. Tomorrow, though, the news was going to be full of images of Effie, since she was supposed to give a briefing to the press.\n\nSunny turned back to the map of Mirage City, studying the clues.\n\nSome time later, though, he threw a furtive glance at the TV.\n\nThe news report was over, and some kind of romantic fantasy drama was on the screen. Frowning derisively, Sunny looked back at the photos of the serial killer's victims.\n\nSome time later, though, he found himself sitting in front of the TV, watching the drama intently.\n\n\"Wow. That… cultivation? Seems extremely bizarre, but does resemble the natural Awakening a bit. What are demonic and orthodox sects, though? Those orthodox guys seem like complete scumbags. Why did they even torture that girl? Just because she saved the Demon King's son? Bah! What a silly show…\"\n\nHe wanted to return to the clues, but somehow found himself still glued to the screen an hour later.\n\n\"What are you doing, foolish girl! That handsome orthodox immortal is clearly harboring an inner demon after you kidnapped him and stared at him the whole night! Knowing that insufferable bore, he will go into seclusion for nine months and expel the inner demon, which will then take human form and come back to haunt you!\"\n\nIt was like she had never suffered from a mind wraith before!\n\nOutraged, Sunny wanted to change the channel… and yet, an hour later, he was still there.\n\n\"No, no, no… don't you see that the Sword Grave is a trap?! You'll never get the Sword of the Lightning Celestial. Instead, you are going to be ambushed by the Ten Orthodox Immortal Sects! What kind of a Demoness are you, fool? And that damn Demon King's son, why the hell is he not advising you better?\"\n\nAnd an hour later:\n\n\"Ah, I see. So the Demon King's son has reached the Lower-Middle Pinnacle of the True Peak of the Highest Pinnacle Realm of the Nascent Soul Domain while you were dead. And it only took him five years! Gods… even if you possessed the body of the Celestial Venerable's daughter, catching up to that fool won't be easy! Even worse, you still think that he betrayed you in the Sword Grave… tsk, just kiss already!\"\n\nAnd a bit later…\n\n\"No, Inner Demon, no! How can you just go and sacrifice yourself?! That obnoxious immortal spent nine whole months in seclusion expelling you, so you have to livе! For mom and dad!\"\n\n...The morning came before he knew it.\n\n***\n\nJust like every day, Saint woke up before dawn broke. Her apartment was spacious and sparsely decorated, filled with a comfortable silence. The rain rustled quietly beyond the panoramic windows, and a thin line of pale lilac was spreading across the cloudy sky far in the distance, slowly dispelling the deep darkness shrouding the city.\n\nShe did not like to hurry, and so, her life was strictly timed and regimented. Every day was approached with forethought and calm precision, making the most out of each minute. Some people tended to compare Saint to an art piece… she rarely paid attention to their flattery, but she did like to think of her life as a piece of art.\n\nAs the artist, she had to craft each day with care to create a flawless masterpiece.\n\nThe morning was a time for exercise, personal hygiene, self-care, and nutrition — so, today, like every day, she started her day with an intense, hour-long exercise routine. Her body was the main tool with which she crafted her life; it was also the foundation of a healthy mind, so she made an effort to maintain it in perfect condition.\n\nExactly an hour later, Saint stopped her exercise and took a ten-minute shower while applying a cleanser lotion and an exfoliating scrub lotion, followed by gentle shampoo and conditioner. Ten more minutes were spent on skincare, followed by ten minutes spent on hair care. Finally, she prepared herself a simple omelet with greens and brewed herself a cup of black coffee.\n\nSaint ate breakfast in silence while reading the news from a well-organized personal feed, marking several scientific articles to be studied later.\n\nFinally, she put on an elegant ensemble prepared for this day at the start of the week and left home.\n\nThe traffic was sparse this early in the morning, and she did not listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks while driving to work. Her car was filled with silence, with only the muted sounds of the waking city seeping inside.\n\nEntering her neat and orderly office after approximately thirty minutes spent in transit, Saint spent ninety more minutes studying patient files and preparing herself for the day. At exactly nine in the morning, the door of her office opened, and her assistant walked in.\n\n\"Dr. Saint, your nine o'clock appointment is here.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Please let them in.\"\n\nThis was the first sound she made since waking up four hours earlier.\n\nSaint took meticulous notes while listening to the patient. After a fifteen-minute break, she saw another client, then left for the rounds in the heavily guarded inpatient wing of her workplace.\n\nEventually, it was time for lunch.\n\nUsually, Saint would have eaten a nutritious meal she had prepared herself, but today, she had a different commitment — even if skipping a meal was suboptimal, her pride as a professional took precedence.\n\nLeaving the hospital, she drove to a nearby building where she was renting a small private office. Her patient was already waiting for her there, leaning on his dirty, ramshackle car while looking at the vista of the city with a distant expression.\n\nThe man himself was quite similar to his car. His clothes were cheap and wrinkled, his hair was disheveled, his complexion was unhealthily pale, while his eyes were bloodshot and red, with deep, dark circles beneath them.\n\nSaint would have been quietly revolted on a usual day, but strangely enough, he seemed quite magnetic despite all that. There was a dark, roguish charm to his messy appearance and cold gaze. Saint also felt a pang of an odd emotion when she saw him.\n\nIt was not quite attraction, but more of… longing? Belonging? She could not tell, and was more than a little surprised at her odd reaction.\n\n\"Detective.\"\n\nHe looked at her, then smiled faintly.\n\n\"Hey, doc. Thank you for making time for me.\"\n\n'Do I… like this man?'\n\nSaint did not mean it in a romantic or physical sense, but simply as a person.\n\nWell, it was no surprise. If there was one thing she valued in people, it was competence — an exceedingly rare trait, by her standards. Saint was a prideful person who excelled in everything she did, and she judged others by the same criteria.\n\nDetective Sunless was as brilliant as he was broken, and he was crafting his life with the same diligence she was… even if the masterpiece he was trying to create seemed more ghastly than beautiful — full of macabre themes and self-destructive tendencies, but impossibly to look away from.\n\nSaint hesitated for a moment.\n\nSomething about him seemed different today…\n\n\"Please. Come in.\""

    "content": "2474 The Devil's Therapist\n\nSaint's private office was smaller than her space at the mental hospital, but better furnished. She prepared a cup of coffee for the patient — a simple act that put most people at ease, easing them into conversation. She usually offered tea to other patients, but considering the detective's chronic insomnia, coffee suited him better.\n\nNaturally, the coffee she made was flawless. Every movement was measured and precise, designed to achieve the optimal result in the most efficient way.\n\nPlacing the elegant cup in front of the pale man, Saint took her seat opposite him and opened her notebook.\n\nShe would only be receiving a symbolic remuneration for this session. But thаt was fine, because she had never been driven by money.\n\nSaint was not driven by compassion or kindness, either. In truth, she had extended an offer to continue treatment to this untidy man for a simple reason — professional pride. She hated leaving things unfinished and flawed, so the thought of letting him go without truly helping him felt distasteful.\n\n\"You look more fatigued than usual today, Detective. Has your insomnia worsened?\"\n\nHe looked at her for a while, then shook his head.\n\n\"No. It's just that… the Demoness and the Demon King's Son. It took them fifty-six episodes to get together, can you believe that?\"\n\nSaint offered him a faint smile and nodded, writing a short sentence down in her notebook.\n\nThe detective fell silent, studying her closely.\n\nShe had noticed him staring before — few people could ever resist stealing glances her way — but today, his gaze was different. It was more inquisitive, somehow.\n\n\"You've returned to duty. That must have been quite a change of pace.\"\n\nHe lingered for a while, then nodded.\n\n\"Yes, well. It was an eye-opening experience. Especially after I met my new partner.\"\n\nSaint silently raised an eyebrow, prompting him to continue.\n\nThe detective smiled.\n\n\"It was a bit ironic, really. We had gone through fire and water, she and I — and yet, she did not remember me at all before. But when we met this time, it was I who did not remember her. Luckily, she reminded me.\"\n\nThen, his expression suddenly livened up.\n\n\"Oh. Actually, Dr. Saint… I had a real breakthrough thanks to her. My partner, I mean — you probably don't remember, but you two know each other. You arm-wrestled once… ah, my poor table…\"\n\nSaint frowned subtly.\n\nWhat was he talking about?\n\nShe did not show much emotion on her face, though.\n\n\"What kind of breakthrough?\"\n\nThe detective gave her a strange look. \"Oh… that... I really wish you didn't ask that question, doc.\"\n\nHis tone sounded a little embarrassed. He remained silent for a short while, then winced.\n\n\"Do you remember all those nightmares I told you about?\"\n\nSaint nodded.\n\n'Is he finally able to sleep soundly? That's great!'\n\nThe detective took a deep breath, then let out a heavy sigh.\n\n\"Well, you see… I realized that they weren't nightmares at all.\"\n\nSaint looked at him, encouraging him to tell her more.\n\nHe offered her a pale smile.\n\n\"Instead, they are the actual reality, and this place is one huge illusion.\"\n\nSaint blinked.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nThe detective nodded.\n\n\"In reality, I am a demigod known as Sunless, the Sovereign of Death, the Dark Lord of the Forgotten Shore, and the commander of the Shadow Legion. I am nearly immortal and possess seven bodies, each capable of destroying entire continents. Of course, most people assume that I was killed by the radiant goddess of humanity, Changing Star, the last daughter of the Immortal Flame. But actually... she is my lover. Even if we recently had a fight while discussing the fate of the world.\"\n\nSaint remained silent for a while. Then, she started to scribble something furiously in her notebook with an inscrutable expression.\n\n'Oh, no. It's a complete breakdown? Schizophrenia? Delusion of grandeur? But there were no signs! Just PTSD and a small collection of mild personality disorders...'\n\nThe detective, meanwhile, continued.\n\n\"Yeah, so, anyway… I am also the heir of Weaver, the Demon of Fate, currently on a quest to collect all seven fragments of their forbidden lineage. One of those fragments is hidden in the mirror labyrinth below the ruined castle of the Demon of Imagination, which was where I went in the company of Effie… Saint Athena. Actually, this whole city is an elaborate illusion contained within the Great Mirror that stands in the middle of the Mirror Maze. So, you see, I am one of the few real people here in Mirage City — everyоne else is a creepy monster only pretending to be human.\"\n\nSaint suppressed a scowl.\n\n'This is bad… that last detail is a common symptom shared by many violent sociopaths.'\n\nAnd what was that, his supposed companion was Athena? As in the stunning maiden goddess of Olympus? Was he fixated on inventing romantic dalliances with goddesses now?\n\nWhere did that come from?!\n\nShe inhaled slowly.\n\n\"Do you… consider me not to be real, Detective?\"\n\nThe detective looked at her in dismay, then shook his head.\n\n\"What? No, of course not! You are perfectly real, doctor. I mean, obviously, you've been brainwashed into believing that you are a mortal psychiatrist residing in Mirage City, which could not be further from the truth.\"\n\nHe coughed.\n\n\"In truth — in reality, I mean — you are the Onyx Saint, my most valued and loyal Shadow. You've been serving me faithfully for more than a decade, following my every command and satisfying my every whim… ever since I killed you. The original you, I mean. By the way, it occurs to me that I've never thanked you for that... so, thank you. It really means a lot.\"\n\nSaint slowly lowered her notebook and looked at the cold, darkly charming man.\n\nThe man who had been oddly obsessed with a serial killer called the Nihilist ever since the two of them met.\n\nSuddenly, it occurred to her that they were alone in the building, with not a living soul in earshot.\n\n'He has completely lost it.'\n\nNo… maybe he had been completely insane this whole time.\n\nHow had she missed it?\n\nSaint looked around subtly, her gaze lingering on a decorative sword that hung on the wall — a garish gift from one of her patients, which she had not had the heart to throw out.\n\n\"Detective… when was the last time you took your medication?\"\n\nMaybe he was just delirious from the lack of sleep…\n\nHe blinked a few times.\n\n\"Oh, my meds? I stopped taking them when I remembered who I really am. Even if I am temporarily trapped in a mortal body, I am still a demigod, you know. Those pills just make me feel loopy.\"\n\nSaint sighed with regret.\n\n'I skipped lunch for this…'"

    "content": "2475 An Astute Deduction\n\nSaint remained silent for a long while. Most people found her silence uncomfortable, awkwardly trying to fill it with meaningless conversations, but the detective seemed calm and at ease... as if he was deeply familiar with her taciturn nature.\n\nShe contemplated him somberly.\n\nWas she in danger?\n\nMore importantly, how had she missed the signs of a looming mental breakdown? Saint pursed her lips slightly. She had failed her patient... and so, her pride was wounded. It was an unpleasant feeling, and that feeling was only made irksome by her failure to pinpoint the origin of her mistake. She looked at the unstable man sitting across from her.\n\nWrinkled clothes, unkempt hair, a pale face, a manic glint in his dark eyes...\n\nThe detective looked back at her and smiled faintly, but his smile never reached the cold depths of his eerie gaze.\n‘The Sovereign of Death, was it?’\nEventually, Saint tapped her pen against her notebook twice.\n\n“Let me share a few thoughts, Detective.\"\nHis smile widened.\n\n“Oh... by all means, doc.\"\n\nShe leaned forward a little and spoke in a calm, indifferent tone:\n\n“It has been several days since you returned to service. Coincidentally, the seventh victim of the Nihilist was discovered at the same time... I strongly suspect that you immediately found a way to insinuate yourself into the case.\"\n\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n\n“Well, that is a simple guess. After all, you know all about my history with that guy, as well as how I ended up suspended and sent to therapy. There is hardly anyone in this world who knows me better than you, really.\"\n\nSaint continued, her voice maintaining its aloof cadence:\n“The identity of the victim has not been disclosed yet — I imagine that is haρpening as we speak at the press conference arranged by the Mirage City Police Department. However, I did see a relevant title while looking through the news articles this morning... it seems that the CEO of the Valor Group had a conversation with two homicide detectives yesterday. You must have been one of those detectives, so it is safe to say that you have not given up on the theory that there is a connection between Mr. Mordret and the Nihilist.\"\n\nHe frowned.\n\n\"Right, you would know about that, too... still, what an astute deduction. It seems that your talents are being wasted on psychiatry, doc. Have you ever considered becoming a detective, instead?\"\n\nSaint ignored the question and looked at him coldly.\n“Naturally, the CEO of the Valor Group is an exalted existence — he is not someone to be treated lightly, and he would not have given you a chance to take advantage of him. So, you failed to reinforce the narrative you believe in by meeting Mr. Mordret. Of course, considering your personality type, that did not convince you to abandon it. Rather, it only convinced you to change tactics.\"\n\nThis time, the detective did not say anything and simply studied her with curiosity.\n\nSaint frowned slightly.\n\n“Or rather, targets. You are a resourceful man, Detective, so you must have found out what Mr. Mordret's weakness is... and where she is being kept.”\n\nHis expression changed subtly, but before he could say anything, Saint finished in an even tone:\n\"So, this whole conversation was an act. You wanted to manipulate me into committing you as a resident patient, which would give you simple access to Miss Morgan. Bravo, Detective. I did not know that you were such a talented actor.\"\n\nThe detective coughed a few times and mumbled quietly:\n\n\"Oops...\"\n\nThen, he looked at her and smiled — the smile was seemingly meant to be bright, but considering his overall appearance, it ended up looking dark and a little threatening instead.\n\n“Guilty as charged. But! That doesn't mean that what I said wasn't true. I am a very honest man in the woгld, you see — two worlds... wait, it's three at the moment, isn't it? The most honest man in three worlds, even. So I really meant all that stuff about being a demigod. I truly am.\"\n\nSaint gave him an impassive look.\n\n“Uh-huh.”\nWith that, she closed her notebook, put the cap on her pen, and rose from her seat. Looking at the pale man from above, she said:\n\n“You attempted to use me, Detective. You also made me doubt my competence, which I do not appreciate. Therefore, I retract my offer to continue these sessions. Let us never meet again... I do encourage you to find a different therapist, though. Be well.\"\nWith that, she headed for the door. He followed in a hurry, gгabbing her arm.\n“Wait a minute, Saint... I mean, Dr. Saint. Actually, I wanted you to meet my partner — she is going to be here soon. Any minute now! Things will be easier once...\"\n\nTurning her head slightly, Saint said in a voice so devoid of emotion that the man seemed to shiver:\n\n“Detective... if you don't unhand me, I am going to break your arm.”\n\nShe meant it, too.\nApart from maintaining her body in a perfect condition, Saint was naturally proficient in self-defense and several martial arts, including karate, taekwondo, judo, aikido, and several southern styles of wushu — a fact that she did not particularly like to advertise.\n\nMartial arts were as much of a hobby for her as they were a necessity, considering how she looked and what kind of people she interacted with due to work. Mostly, however, they were a training tool. After all, what was the point of working on her body if she did not know how to use it?\n\nStill, Detective Sunless was no random stranger. He was a seasoned fighter himself — and, unlike Saint, he had earned his experience in actual brawls, not on a clean tatami. Plus, he was a man... even if his stature was modest, she did not harbor any delusions about which one of them was physically stronger.\n\nHe could very well disregard her threat...\nHowever, he did not.\nIn fact, the detective seemed to believe her promise a little too willingly, as if he was giving Saint more credit than she was giving herself.\n\nLetting go of her arm, he took a hurried step back.\n\n“N—no need to get violent, Saint! I mean... Dr. Saint. See? I let go.\"\n\nTurning away with a frown, Saint headed for the door.\n\nJust before leaving, she threw over her shoulder:\n\n\"Do not approach me again, Detective. If you do, I will revoke my assessment of your mental state and make sure that you never work in law enforcement again.\"\n\nHer voice was indifferent, and her gaze was cold.\n\nClosing the door behind her, Saint frowned.\nWhy did she feel so uncomfortable?\n‘Strange.’\n\nLeaving him behind somehow felt profoundly wrong.\nBut it wasn't. It was what she ought to have done — one of life's golden rules was to never waste time on people who did not deserve it, after all, and Saint followed that rule faithfully.\n\nPursing her lips, she shook her head and walked away.\n\nLeft alone in the office, Sunny winced and cursed quietly.\n\n“Damnation. That did not go as ρlanned at all. Where the hell is Effie? She was supposed to be here by now!\"\n\nBut there was no sign of his partner.\nEventually, he sighed.\n\n“Well... let's look at the bright side. At least my bones are still intact...\""

    "title": "2476 Irregular Programming.docx",
    "content": "2476 Irregular Programming\n\nBy the time Sunny left the building, Saint was gone. He raised the collar of his jacket to prevent the rain from seeping under it and hid under the eaves of a nearby convenience store, taκing out his communicator with an unhappy expression. Effie was running late. She was supposed to call him as soon as her press conference was over and then arrive shortly after—today, they had hoped to make Saint remember who she truly was.\n\nObviously, that plan would have to be reworked now.\n\n‘Saint is too damn smart.’\n\nHe knew, of course, that his Shadow was highly intelligent. However, since she never spoke, Sunny never realized just how keenly astute she really was. It had taken her only a few minutes to deduce exactly what he was doing, why he was doing it, and what his end goal was.\nHow had she figured him out so swiftly? Sunny had improvised most of his confession on the spot, true, but his supposed mental breakdown was quite believable—after all, everything he had said was true. More than that, correctly guessing his interest in Morgan was not something he would have expected her to do.\n\nIt seemed that getting into the private wing of the mental institution was not going to be easy. His tentative plan to broaden the confines of what the Devil Detective's role allowed him to do by pretending to be mentally unstable, and therefore unpredictable, had not panned out either. They would have to make Saint remember her true self—if his theory was sound and Effie could work her magic again—first... but even that had become difficult now, since the taciturn therapist did not intend to see him ever again.\n\n‘Damn it.’\n\nSunny did not like being in Saint's bad books. That had literally never happened to him before.\nFrustrated and full of discontent, he looked at his communicator, as if asking it why Effie had not called.\n\nThe communicator...\n\nWas dead.\n\nIts screen was black, and it did not respond to anything Sunny did.\n\nHe blinked a few times.\n\n‘Don't tell me...’\n\nWere these things supposed to be recharged daily, as well?!\n\n‘No... no way.’\n\nThis was just too impractical!\n\nSunny stared at the dead device in utter shock for a while, then raised his hand in anger to toss the damn thing at the wall. Evеntually, though, he let out a long sigh and lowered it, deciding to spare the battered communicator.\n\nNot the least of all because he had no idea how to procure a new one.\nRummaging through the Devil Detective memories, Sunny found the vague recollection of how to use the primitive, unwieldy communicators of the bygone era... the mobile phones. Covering his face with a palm for a few moments, he groaned quietly, and then walked to his car.\nClimbing inside, Sunny started the engine and found a threadbare cable that was supposed to serve as a charger. The port where the cable was supposed to go seemed to have become loose over time, so he only managed to make the barbaric technology work after fiddling with it for a while... needless to say, his mood did not improve one bit as a result. Finally, the communicator started to charge.\n\nA couple of minutes later, Sunny was able to turn it on. What met him was an angry notification denoting that he had a dozen missed calls.\nTo his frustration, raising the communicator resulted in the contact between the charging cable and the port being lost, so he had to wait a few more minutes before being able to return the call. He spent those minutes quietly seething and cursing the archaic technology of the past era.\n\n‘This might be a golden age, but charging things so often? And with wires, of all things?! Wires, really?!’\n\nAnd the people! From what Sunny gleaned from the Devil Detective's memories, they were glued to these primitive things and obsessed with them, to the point of acting tribal. The communicator model you possessed denoted both your allegiance and social status, and those who used the wrong ones were often bullied, mocked, and ostracised. This odd behavior was actively encouraged by the manufacturers, as well.\nIt was to the point that people went into debt to purchase expensive communicators they could not really afford.\n\n‘Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous!’\nIt seemed that even living in the apocalypse had its advantages!\n\nWhen his battered communicator finally gained enough charge, Sunny dialed Effie. She responded almost immediately, her voice sounding a little grumpy:\n\n\"Where the hell have you been? I couldn't reach you.”\n\nSunny coughed in embarrassment.\n\n“Oh, that. I was with Saint. My communicator... might have been powered down.\"\n\n‘What a... wait a minute’\n\nSunny paled.\n\n‘I was alone with Saint... my communicator was turned off... oh, no!’\n\nIt took a Cursed Terror and being banished from fate to make Effie stop joking about Saint being his girlfriend. And he just gave her ammunition to start that damned joke again!\nSunny hurriedly spoke into the communicator, hoping to interrupt and confuse Effie before she could say anything: “Anyway! How did your press conference go? Were the journalists very annoying? What about the Captain? Was he pleased? Did the PR department shower you with praise? They did, didn't they?!\"\n\nEffie remained silent for a few moments, then said in a strangely grim tone:\n\n\"I get it you didn't watch my press conference, then.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n“No... why, what happened?\"\n\nIt was then that he finally registered the noises in the background—the sounds of dozens of people talking, phones ringing, and the Captain berating someone at the top of his lungs.\n\nEffie sighed.\n\n\"Go check the news. Then come back here. We... might have a problem.’\n\nWith that, she ended the call.\nSunny frowned, then assessed the local version of the network and opened the news feed.\n\nImmediately, his exрression darkened.\n\"What?\"\n\nPretty much every news article on the first few pages all showed the same picture: a road littered with broken glass and debris, with a wide gap in the bent and torn metal railing on its side and blood smeared on the wet asphalt.\n\nThe titles were all sensational, but said the same thing...\n\n“Breaking news! The Valor Group CEO rushed to the hospital after a failed assassination attempt!\"\n\nSunny threw the communicator down and grabbed the wheel.\n\n‘Curse it all... what now?!\""

    "title": "2477 Nothing Ventured.docx",
    "content": "2477 Nothing Ventured\n\nThe Mirage City Police Department was boiling. By the time Sunny arrived, the Homicide Division Captain wasn't screaming at his subordinates anymore—instead, he was being screamed at by someone higher up the chain. The same was probably happening in other Divisions, even if there was no real point. People just wanted to be seen being indignant to prove their loyalty. It seemed that an attempt on Mordret's life was at least a hundred times more important than the Nihilist and his seven victims. As if the whole Mirage City revolved around one person.\n\nLooking around with a frown, Sunny ignored the carnage and found Effie. She was leaning on the wall in the staff kitchen of the Homicide Division, munching on a flamboyant circle-shaped pastry with pink frosting and rainbow-colored sprinkles. There was a large, empty box in front of her, as well.\n“Oh, partner! Listen... I discovered these things called donuts. They are simply to die for!\"\n\nHe gave her a long stare, then gritted his teeth.\n\n“Yeah? Well, if they are so delicious... did you not think to leave one for me, huh?\"\nShe blinked a couple of times, then hurriedly swallowed the rest of her donut and grinned.\n\n“Oops. Sorry. There's none left!\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n“Anyway, is that important right now? What exactly happened to Mordret?\"\n\nEffie wiped her hands on a paper towel, then tossed it into the trash bin and shrugged.\n\n\"Someone tried to kill him, that's what. Even worse... it happened during my press conference, so all the journalists just whipped out their communicators and ignored me completely. My very own debut! It was completely ruined...\"\nShe gave him a sorrowful look.\n\n“Apparently, Mordret's PTV was crossing a bridge when a truck swerved from the oncoming lane and rammed it at full speed. Both vehicles fell into the river... the collision seemed premeditated, too. The driver died on the spot, Mordret's chauffeur is in critical condition. The man himself escaped with only minor injuries, though.”\nShe shook her head and sighed.\n\n“His PTV was built like a tank, apparently, with an entire arsenal of airbags—I am guessing that is why it was pushed into the water. He managed to swim to shore, though. Not only that, he even stayed behind at first to rescue his driver from the wreckage and dragged the unconscious guy to shore with him. Real heroic stuff... I'm sure the news articles will be colorful tomorrow.”\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\nMordret? Doing something selfless?\n“What's the truck driver's identity?\"\n\nEffie shrugged.\n“Just a random nobody with no apparent connection to Mordret. No score to settle with the Valor Group, either. Lots of gambling debts, though.”\n\nSunny lingered for a few moments, then asked:\n\n\"I am guessing we won't be able to see Mordret in the hospital, will we?\"\n\nEffie scoffed.\n\n“Not a chance. In any case, sorry that I did not show up. As soon as the news broke, it was all hands on deck here—I couldn't leave without drawing suspicion. How did the date with your therapist go?\"\n\nSunny gave her a wistful look.\n\n“It went terribly... wait, no! It wasn't a date. Don't you dare start that crap again!\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, and then added somberly:\n\n\"She threatened to break my arm and end my career if I ever showed up in front of her again. So... not what you'd call a success.”\nEffie looked at the empty box of donuts with regret, sighed, and looked at him with an uncertain expression.\n\n\"Anyway... I don't like it. There is a lot going on, but things aren't clicking into place. Mordret, the Nihilist, and the victims—there is nothing that really connects them. And who would want to kill Mordret here? Apart from Morgan, who has been locked up in a mental asylum this whole time.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“Either we are missing something, or there is a third party involved. Someone we are not aware of.\"\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, contemplating her words.\n\n‘Who would want to kill Mordret?'\n\nA hint of a sudden suspicion ignited in his mind.\n\nHe lingered for a moment, then said quietly:\n“Any number of people would want to kill the CEO of the Valor Group. Who would want to kill Mordret, though? That is a fаr better question.\"\nEffie raised an eyebrow.\n\n“Have you figured out something?\"\n\nSunny remembered the makeshift investigation board hidden at the back of the Devil Detective's closet. The map of the city, the details of the case, the photos of the victims...\n\nThe ghastly, bloated face of the young man they had found on the river shore flashed in his mind.\n\n“Maybe. But... let's discuss it somewhere else. I don't think the Captain will notice if we slip away in the chaos.”\n\nThe two of them left the police building and drove to Sunny's shabby apartment in silence. On the way, he kept thinking, his frown growing deeper and deeper.\n\nEffie must have sensed his strange mood, because she did not even joke about being invited into a strange man's home when they arrived.\nEntering the apartment, Sunny went directly to the closet and opened it, revealing the investigation board. He took out the case file of the recent murder and pinned the photo of the latest victim alongside the others, then took a step back and studied them all once again.\n\nA handsome young man in an unassuming black suit, the tip of a black tattoo barely visible above his collar. A woman with a weathered face wearing cheap clothes. A hunched old man with a neatly trimmed beard. A broad-shouldered man with a chiseled face and muscular figure. A young woman wearing hospital scrubs... and a couple of others.\n\n‘I've seen them before.’\n\nThere seemed to be nothing common between them. Their age, gender, professions, social status, and physical profile were all different—as if the Nihilist did not care who he killed at all.\n\nThere was no apparent pattern in the places where the bodies were found, either. It was all maddeningly random.\n“What do you see?\"\n\nEffie studied the investigation board, then shrugged.\n\n\"A lot of red strings? Most of the bodies were found near water, but that is probably just a coincidence. Mirage City is full of rivers, not to mention the two lakes. Plus, this damn rain has not stopped for weeks.”\nSunny winced.\n\n“The victims. Don't they remind you of something?\"\n\nEffie frowned.\n\n“Well... come to think of it, they do look familiar. But that is probably because my counterpart saw the news reports when they were killed.”\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n“No. They look familiar to you, not to your counterpart. It took me a while to remember, but when you asked who would want to kill Mordret, I finally did.\"\n\nHe pursed his lips.\n\"I guess my thinking has been tainted by the lingering feelings of the Devil Detective, who was convinced that Mordret was the killer. That is why it took me so long to connect the dots.\"\n\nEffie blinked a few times.\n\n\"So, you don't think that Mordret is the killer anymore?\"\n\nSunny slowly shook his head, then pointed at one of the photos—the one of the broad-shouldered, athletic man.\n\n“This guy. He was a lawyer here in Mirage City, but in the real world, his name was Awakened Warren. He was a retainer of Clan Valor... before Mordret took him as a vessel.”\nEffie frowned, then looked at the photos once again. Then, her eyes widened slightly.\nShe recоgnized them.\n\nThe two of them had seen these people before. It had happened in the Third Nightmare... when Mordret had taken them into his nascent Mirror Realm.\n\nWhere his morbid wardrobe of stolen bodies was stored.\n\"These are... Mordret's vessels.\"\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n“They are. Nothing connects these people in Mirage City, but actually, they all shared the same fate in the real world. They became Mordret's vessels. So, you see... Mordret is not the killer.\"\n\nHe sighed, then closed his eyes for a moment.\n\n\"He is the victim.\"\n\nThe Nihilist... was hunting Mordret down."

    "content": "2478 Nothing Gained\n\nHearing Sunny call Mordret the victim, Effie let out a short laugh. Then, her expression grew serious.\n\n“That sounds like a bit of divine justice... quite amusing really to imagine, rеally. But we both know that the gods are dead, and there is no justice in the world unless we dispense it ourselves. In any case, this is not particularly good news for us, is it?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“We seem to have discovered an important piece of the puzzle... but really, we know even less now than we did this morning. We at least had a suspect before — but if Mordret is not the Nihilist and is instead being hunted by the Nihilist, then we don't even have a suspect. We have nothing at all.” She sighed and rubbed her face tiredly. “Listen... what was our plan again? Get to Mordret, get contгol of the Component back from him, find what you are looking for, and return to Bastion. We've mеt Mordret and gained nothing. Now with this new revelation, it does not even seem like he is the one who stole my administrator rights. So what do we do? How are we getting back to the real world, Sunny?\"\n\nHe remained silent for a few moments, then shrugged.\n\n“Nothing changed. We've met Mordret, but we did not really get to him, did we? Now that we know that his life is in danger, we can apply pressure and get closer. Plus, there is also Saint and Morgan — we have not even reached them yet, so it is too early to draw conclusions. We are supposed to play the roles of detectives, so think like a detective, Effie. We will be patient, slowly build the case, and solve the mystery. That is how we are going to get back.\"\n\nSunny studied her expression, then raised an eyebrow. “But why are you hesitating all of a sudden? I know you well enough to know that you would not have been shaken by something as trivial as a temporary lack of progress. Serial killers, corrupt authorities, unseen dangers... none of that sounds like something that would rattle you. So what is going on?\"\n\nEffie met his gaze silently, then grimaced and looked away.\n\n\"Every evening, I have to go home to an unfamiliar husband and take care of unfamiliar kids. That is what is going on.\" Sunny raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"That... that's it? You are scared of the creepy Other who plays the role of your husband?\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly.\n\n\"No. It's the children.\"\n\nEffie looked Sunny in the eye.\n\n“I'm afraid... that I will grow to love them. If we spend too much time here, I will...\"\n\nShe smiled slightly and shook her head again. “You probably won't understand, but that frightens me far more than serial killers and unseen dangers ever could. We can leave, but what will happen to them when we leave? It is foolish, I know. They aren't even real children. But the longer we stay here, the harder it is to make that distinction.\" Sunny stared at Effie, surprised.\n\nShe was right, he did not understand... but he did as well, in a way.\n\nSunny could not really comprehend why she would be so vulnerable to her counterpart's children, in particular, but he knew how impossible it was not to treat phantoms as real people.\n\nEvery time Sunny entered a Nightmare, he reminded himself that the people populating them were not real. And every time, he failed to treat them as anything but.\n\nAuro of the Nine, Elyas, Solvane, Noctis, Ananke, Wind Flower, even that brat Chronos... they toоk more space in his heart than most actual people did, even if he knew that they had been conjured by the Spell. Sunny sighed.\n\n“I understand. But...\"\n\nBefore he could finish, though, his communicator exploded with an angry ringing. He frowned, then retrieved it from his pocket and looked at the screen. “Damn it.\"\n\nAccepting the call, Sunny brought the communicator to his ear... then winced and moved it a few centimeters away when a familiar voice thundered out of the speaker. “Where the hell are you, bastard?!\"\n\nSunny closed his eyes in exasperation.\n\n\"I was going over some materials of the Nihilist case with Detective Athena at a secondary location, Captain... sir.”\n\nThe Captain's voice sounded almost apoplectic.\n\n“The Nihilist case?! What Nihilist case, you imbecile?! Does that damn Nihilist matter now, damn it?!\"\n\nSunny exhaled slowly. “With all due respect, sir, it matters just as much as it mattered before some conglomerate heir took a dive from a bridge...\"\n\nThe torrent of expletives that poured out of the communicator made him wince again. After about a minute, the Captain's ire finally exhausted itself. He breathed heavily into his communicator, then said hoarsely: “Listen here, you foul gremlin... get your ass to the headquarters immediately. Put on a siren and run every damn red light on your way here if you need to. And take Athena with you!\"\n\nThe man paused for a moment, then added in an angry voice:\n\n“And don't you dare corrupt her with your vile influence, you hear me?! Unlike you, deadbeat, she's a promising young dеtective!\"\n\nSunny's eyes widened in outrage.\n\n\"W—what did he say? Me? Corrupt her? That obscene heap of delinquency?! Who will corrupt whom?!”\nHe took a few deep breaths to calm himself, then said evenly:\n\n“I hear you loud and clear, Captain. But, sir... why do you even need us to come? I'd think that you would want to keep me as far away from that Valor guy's case as possible.\"\n\nHis supposed boss remained silent for a while, then cursed quietly.\n\n“You'd be goddamn right! If it were up to me, your pale mug would have gotten nowhere near this case. But... it's not up to me. Congratulations, I guess!\"\n\nSunny and Effie looked at each other. “What do you mean, sir?\"\n\nThe Captain let out a frustrated sigh.\n\n“Mr. Mordret personally requested you... he asked for you by name. So, here we are!\"\n\nHe paused, and then added tiredly:\n\n“This investigation... has been assigned exclusively to you two. So move your asses!\" Sunny looked at Effie with wide eyes.\n\nShe seemed quite surprised, too.\nIt seemed like they were going to see Mordret again much sooner than they had anticipated."

    "title": "2479 Valiant CEO.docx",
    "content": "2479 Valiant CEO\n\nSome time before that, Mordret, the CEO of the Valor Group, was left alone in his office after the two detectives left... or rather, he was left in the company of his vast entourage — a person of his status was never really alone, which suited him fine.\n\nMordret remained seated in his chair for a while, moving his finger across the handrest absent-mindedly.\n\nHis executive assistant bowed deeply.\n\n\"I am extremely sorry, sir. This will never happen again.\"\n\nThe head of his security bowed, too.\n\n\"I will contact the responsible parties immediately. These nobodies will be thrown out of thе Police Department by tomorrow… since it was my negligence that allowed them to disturb you, I will accept any punishment with gratitude.\"\n\nMordret remained silent for a while, his gaze distant, then looked at them with surprise.\n\n\"What? No, don't do anything. Why would we want to be rid of these valiant detectives? I actually... find them quite admirable.\"\n\nThe man, Sunless, was known as the Devil Detective. He was an ace of Mirage PD and somewhat of an unsung hero — a rare officer who was both competent and incorruptible, even if that seemed to have taken a toll on him. Mordret was more than aware of his stellar track record, as well as of his peculiar personality.\n\nThe woman, meanwhile…\n\nReminiscing about his youth, Mordret smiled fondly.\n\nWho knew that he would meet the star athlete, Athena, one day? And she was a detective now! As a young man, he had been a huge fan of hers… he might have even developed a small crush, which earned him a disproportionate amount of teasing from Morgan.\n\nAt the thought of his sister, his smile dimmed a little.\n\nMordret sighed.\n\n\"You know, I had a bit of a lonely childhood. But there was this stack of old detective stories in my grandfather's attic… I was probably too young to be reading them, but who was going to stop me? Those books kept me company, and what an exciting company it was! I have had a soft spot for detectives ever since.\"\n\nShaking his head, he looked at his assistant.\n\n\"Anyway, leave them alone. What is on my schedule? I imagine that the board meeting had to be moved because of this unexpected delay.\"\n\nThe assistant, who had been bowing this whole time, finally straightened.\n\n\"The board is waiting, sir — as they should. The chairman is quite impatient, as you know, but he does not dare complain. The issues on the agenda for today's meeting are as follows: budget allocation for the R&D activities in the next quarter, preliminary discussion of the government contracts regarding repair and restoration after the forecasted flood damage, issues concerning the increased financing of our charitable initiatives…\"\n\nMordret listened silently, then nodded.\n\n\"Nothing out of the ordinary, then… wait. Repairs after the forecasted flood damage?\"\n\nThe assistant nodded.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nMordret looked at him with a confused expression.\n\n\"What about preventative measures? Why is there nothing on the agenda regarding that?\"\n\nThe assistant shifted uncomfortably, then said in a flat tone:\n\n\"Well… it's because there's little to no money to be made in prevention, sir. Naturally.\"\n\nMordret closed his eyes for a mоment.\n\n\"Naturally, huh?\"\n\nRising from his seat, he gave his аssistant a somber glance and headed for the door.\n\n\"I guess I'll be making changes to today's agenda then, after all.\"\n\n***\n\nThe day passed in the usual busy work. Late in the evening, Mordret was driven home in his luxurious car. Sitting in the leather seat, he looked at the vistas of Mirage City floating by with a distant expression on his face. His assistant continued to report something from the front, but he did not seem to be listening.\n\nOne would think that a man of nearly endless wealth and status would be out enjoying the infinite pleasurеs life had to offer in his free time, but actually, Mordret led an almost monastic life. His days were usually spent between the offices of the Valor Group and his manor, and what little free time he had was spent with family.\n\nHe had been different in his youth, but for many years now, Mordret focused solely on these two things — family and work. Despite being surrounded by countless people every day, he was a solitary person. Nobody really knew what was going on in his head, and what emotions hid behind his perfectly pleasant and mild-mannered facade.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\nMordret looked away from the window, shaken awake from his reverie.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nHis assistant handed him a document.\n\n\"This is the flood prevention plan you requested. It is a preliminary report, but Valor Construction has been quite efficient in compiling a list of possible measures…\"\n\nThe car flew through the rain, eventually reaching the shores of the Mirror Lake. From here, one could see the proud walls of the historic castle that served as the most recognizable landmark of Mirage City. Valor Manor was situated on the shore of the lake, surrounded by several acres of old woods.\n\nThe family butler, Sebastian, met Mordret at the door and bowed with his usual refined elegance.\n\n\"Welcome home, Young Master.\"\n\nMordret smiled at the aging man and walked inside.\n\nOnce there, he looked around with a subtly lost expression on his face.\n\nThe manor… felt terribly empty as of late.\n\nHis grandfather had long moved to one of their vacation homes in the countryside. His parents were away on one of their trips. Morgan… Morgan was temporarily away, as well.\n\nMordrеt was faced with an empty silence for the first time in a long while.\n\nHe stopped near a family portrait hanging above the fireplace in the main foyer and studied it for a while. His assistant, who had followed him inside, finished the report and bowed.\n\n\"If there is nothing else, I will depart now, sir. Please have a good rest.\"\n\nMordret nodded slowly, letting the man go, but then stopped him suddenly.\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\nThe assistant looked back.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\nMordret hesitated for a few moments.\n\n\"In the morning… the detectives mentioned a blood sample found on the crime scene. Was my blood really found there?\"\n\nHis assistant frowned.\n\n\"I can check the veracity of their claims if you want, sir. However, I don't see why they would lie about such a thing.\"\n\nMordret remained silent for a moment.\n\n\"...Who ordered to suppress the investigation, then?\"\n\nThe man blinked a few times. It seemed that he had been anticipating a different question —who was behind planting the blood sample on the crime scene, for example.\n\nHe looked down.\n\n\"I assume that it was the chairman of the board, sir.\"\n\nMordret pursed his lips.\n\n\"The chairman again, huh?\"\n\nSoon enough, he was left alone in front of the family portrait.\n\nMordret stared at it for a long time, his expression slowly growing more and more troubled.\n\nEventually, he whispered:\n\n\"Are you still there? Have you come back?\"\n\nOf course, there was no answer.\n\nTurning away from the portrait, Mordret quietly walked away."

    "content": "2480 Alter Ego\n\nIn the morning, Mordret informed Sebastian that there would be a change of plans. He was supposed to go straight to the office, but instead, he decided to visit Morgan.\n\n\"Master and Madam informed me that they would be returning to Mirage City post haste, Young Master. We should be expecting them in a matter of days.\"\n\nMordret smiled.\n\n\"Finally, some good news!\"\n\nThe driver had the car ready by the time he left the manor. The man hurriedly opened an umbrella to escort Mordret to the luxurious vehicle, then pulled open the door and looked down.\n\nMordret patted him on the shoulder.\n\n\"I'll be spending several hours with Morgan. No need to wait — treat yourself to something warm and delicious on the company bill. Just make sure to come pick me up at noon.\"\n\nHis driver had been serving the family for more than a decade now, and used to drive Mordret to and from the university. Hearing that he would have some free time today, he smiled.\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nAs the car drove toward the distant clinic where Morgan was being treated, Mordret suddenly remembered the detectives from the day before.\n\nThey were an amusing pair. The man was of a modest stature and deathly pale, rough around the edges, while the woman was tall with olive skin, soft and maternal despite her flawlessly athletic figure. By all accounts, they were complete opposites — almost like a pair of mismatched partners straight from the pages of the detective stories he once loved to read.\n\nBut that was not why Mordret was suddenly reminded of them.\n\n'Snap out of it… was that what Detective Athena said?'\n\nStrange words, not at all suitable for the occasion.\n\nHe could almost feel the heat of her touch on his shoulder, still…\n\nA fantastical suspicion entered Mordret's mind, and a subtle crease appeared on his brow.\n\nJust then, the car drove onto the wide bridge. One escort vehicle was in front of it, while another was behind — the rain was so intense that they could barely be seen, and the headlights of the cars in the oncoming lane fused into a blur.\n\nMordret was deep in thought, a complicated expression twisting the fine lines of his face.\n\nIt was then that something on the periphery of his vision attracted his attention.\n\nLooking up, he just barely had time to notice a ramshackle truck in the oncoming lane taking a sharp turn.\n\nThen, everything happened too fast to react.\n\nThe truck caught the rear bumper of the escort vehicle, throwing the car aside in an explosion of debris. Then, it rammed the luxury car behind it at full speed.\n\nMordret would have been thrown against the wall of the leather-bound interior if not for the airbags that instantly deployed. Still, he received a vicious shaking and was completely disoriented because of the blow.\n\nThe seat belt dug into his chest, suffocating him.\n\nDazed, Mordret heard an ear-piercing scratching sound and felt the car moving sideways. Then, there was another impact…\n\nAnd he could suddenly feel his body growing light.\n\nThe car was falling.\n\n'Thе river…'\n\nBefore Mordret could finally realize what was happening, there was a third impact, this one the most violent. The deflated airbags still protected him, but then, he felt water streaming across his legs.\n\nShaking off his disorientation, Mordret looked around.\n\nIt only took him a split second to assess the situation.\n\nThe car was severely damaged, its windows bгoken, and sinking into the swollen river. The water was already inside the cabin, rising swiftly at a steep angle.\n\nHe was hopelessly entangled in the seat belt and imprisoned in a soft cage of airbags, moments away from being submerged into the cold darkness.\n\n'Ah…'\n\nMordret tugged on the seat belt, but instead of releasing him, it seemed completely stuck in place.\n\nWell, of course it was… seat belts were designed to resist sudden jerking motions.\n\nThe icy-cold water covered his head, and he suddenly couldn't breathe.\n\nRemaining calm, Mordret pulled on the seat belt slowly, loosened its grip, then ducked under and freed himself. Then, he disentangled himself from the airbags and looked through the murky water at the broken window on the opposite side of the car's interior.\n\nHis lungs were already starting to burn.\n\nBut salvation was so close… all he had to do was climb through the window, then swim to the surface.\n\nMordret was prepared to do just that when his gaze fell on the unconscious shape in the driver's seat.\n\nHe remained motionless for a moment, then moved in the opposite direction from the broken window and pushed himself through the narrow opening between the passenger compartment and the driver's cabin.\n\nThe car was sinking swiftly, and it was already terribly dark around. The driver's side had received the most damage in the collision and was completely deformed, as well. Suffering from the lack of oxygen, Mordret felt around for the release of the driver's seat belt and tried to disengage it. However, no matter how he tried, the bent clasp refused to let go. He was already suffocating by then.\n\nGritting his teeth, Mordret twisted the clasp and pressed the release button with all his strength. Finally, the set belt slipped from the locking mechanism, allowing him to grab his driver and drag them both to the broken windshield.\n\n'Ah… this… is harder than it looks in movies…'\n\nMordret followed a relatively rigorous athletic regimen, and he was especially fond of swimming — however, the stylish clothes he was so fond of were now weighing him down like cinderblocks, pulling him deeper into the water. More than that, the weight of his driver's unconscious body was simply unbearable.\n\nHe was already struggling to push his own through the cold mass of dark, restless water — dragging another man аlong was simply too strenuous, too difficult.\n\nAnd his lungs were on fire. His lungs begged for oxygen, and a panicked terror was flooding his mind, demanding that he let go of his heavy burden and save himself.\n\nBut Mordret refused.\n\nInstead, he fought against the water with all the strength he could muster, even if his vision was already starting to darken.\n\nThen, finally…\n\nHis head broke through the surface of the water, and Mordret drew in a feverish breath.\n\nThe shore seemed terribly far, but he managed to reach it, somehow, after all.\n\nDragging himself and the driver onto the ground, Mordret fell down, utterly spent.\n\nHe was so cold.\n\nTaking several hoarse breaths, he pushed himself off the ground and bent over the driver.\n\n\"Hey… hey, are you…\"\n\nWas he dead?\n\nParalyzed by fear, Mordret lightly slapped the man across the cheek.\n\nTo his great relief, the driver groaned, coughed out a mouthful of water, and slowly opened his eyes.\n\nMordret let out a relieved sigh.\n\n\"Thank the gods!\"\n\nBut then… something about the driver felt off.\n\nHis eyes grew strangely glassy, full of something unfamiliar and cold.\n\nIn the next moment, the man's gloved hand closed around Mordret's neck.\n\n'What…'\n\nSuddenly ferociously... inhumanly... strong, the driver strangled Mordret while pulling him down to the ground and climbing atop of him.\n\nWide-eyed, Mordret tried to pry the man's hands off his neck, but it was of no use. It was as if his neck was being squeezed by an iron vice, seconds away from snapping.\n\nEven if his neck somehow survived, he would be strangled to death before too long.\n\n'What is…'\n\nAs he struggled desperately, hopelessly, Mordret's vision started to darken for the second time today. The driver's eerie, glassy eyes were the only thing he saw.\n\n'N—no...'\n\nIt was then that a shadow suddenly covered them, and something cold flashed in the air.\n\nHot blood splattered across Mordret's face, and he suddenly could breathe again.\n\nPushing the driver away, he climbed back and saw a slender figure leaning over the crazed man. A sharp knife flashed again, plunging into the driver's flesh once more. More blood spilled onto the wet ground.\n\nThe figure twisted the knife, then coldly kicked the man in the wounded side, throwing him back into the water.\n\n\"W—who…\"\n\nThe knife-wielding stranger was standing with his back to Mordret, wearing a cheap, ragged raincoat and an unassuming cap. Countered against the gray sky and the dark line of the distant bridge, his tall figure seemed both threatening and strangely familiar.\n\nFinally, the stranger turned around and looked down at Mordret, his cold gaze full of irritation and contempt.\n\nMordret flinched as he saw the stranger's face.\n\n…His own face.\n\nAs the stranger leaned down, blood still dripping from his hands, Mordret remained frozen in place. His reflection was pale and shocked in the other Mordret's mirror-like eyes.\n\nThe other's face split into a pleasant smile, and he whispered into Mordret's ear, his insidious voice full of barely contained hatred:\n\n\"Hey, wastrel… can't you even keep yourself alive? You weak, worthless fool. Do I have to do everything for you?\"\n\nThe tip of the knife bit vindictively into Mordret's cheek, leaving a shallow cut on it.\n\nThere were shouts and the sound of sirens in the distance.\n\n…By the time he could finally move, the other was already gone, as if he had never existed.\n\nRaising a shaking hand, Mordret touched his cheek.\n\nHis hand came down bloody.\n\nLooking at the blood smeared across his fingers...\n\nMordret suddenly smiled brightly.\n\n\"He's back!\""

    "content": "2481 Broken Mirror\n\nAs they drove to the hospital, both Sunny and Effie were alternating between feeling wary and confused.\n\nThe roads were congested because of the rain — the failing storm drains were spouting foaming torrents of water here and there, causing some outermost lanes to be entirely flooded. Taller PTVs barreled their way through the puddles, but smaller vehicles had to huddle to the middle of the road, crawling slowly. Sunny's rust bucket was, sadly, one of the latter.\n\n'My Rhino… would never…'\n\nSunny sighed.\n\nAt that moment, Effie finally spoke:\n\n\"Why would he want us to handle his case?\"\n\nHer voice was full of suspicion.\n\nSunny hesitated for a while, then shrugged.\n\n\"That depends. Does he really not remember anything, or were we fooled? Either way, we'll find out when we get there.\"\n\nEffie grimaced.\n\n\"Listen, partner, you probably don't know that guy well. But I had the misfortune of conquering two Nightmares with him… so believe me when I tell you, he is a demon. And not in a cool, sexy way — more so in the creepy, there is something deeply wrong with this bastard way.\"\n\nShe paused for a moment, then added somberly:\n\n\"First of all, as you might know already, he is immortal. The Great Clan Valor and his own father went out of their way to find a way to kill him, but they failed. All they could do was turn a Citadel on the Chained Isles into an inescapable prison to contain him, complete with a Transendent warden and a hundred Lost guards. But he still escaped, massacring everyone in that Citadel in the process — Cassie was the only one who survived.\"\n\nSunny smiled sadly, but did not say anything.\n\nEffie looked at him with a dark expression.\n\n\"In the Second Nightmare, he slaughtered an entire kingdom. Then, he played Song and Valor against each other and provoked the Battle of the Black Skull — if not for his machinations, Whispering Blade and gods know how many more people would have still been alive. We saw a Defiled version of his Transcendent self consume literally millions of people in the Tomb of Ariel… that thing was not an abomination. It was an entire nation, in and of itself.\"\n\nA bitter smile appeared on her lips.\n\n\"And while he did not swallow millions of people in the real world, he did devour and take out an entire Great Clan all by himself. Not only that, but by doing so, he completely changed the course of the war between the Sovereigns, giving Ki Song a chance to win. He would have conquered the entire Sword Domain, too — without an army, all by himself — if not for the trick Morgan and Jet pulled off in Bastion.\"\n\nShe sighed and shook her head.\n\n\"Even then, technically, he accomplished what he wanted to accomplish there by stealing a Great Citadel from Anvil without even setting foot in it. And without that Cursed Demon you somehow lulled to sleep and delivered to me, who knows what would have happened? In any case, the very fact that a Cursed Demon was needed tо handle a mere Saint says everything one needs to know about Mordret of Nowhere, already. What I mean to say is… he might not have taken the last step to Supremacy like the two of you did, but he did just about everything but.\"\n\nEffie scowled.\n\n\"That guy is not right in the head, not right at all. You looked into that guy's eyes, so you should know — something is amiss there. I don't know what he is missing, but whatever it is, it's the thing that makes us humans... human.\"\n\nSunny looked at her with a subtle frown, contemplating.\n\n'Something is missing...'\n\nEffie's words had reminded him of his own old impression of the Prince of Nothing, and something about it all suddenly seemed to hide an elusive meaning.\n\nA completely bizarre idea was slowly forming in his mind. It seemed a little too strange to be true… but also a little too fitting to simply discard it.\n\n'That is... impossible, right?'\n\nHe lingered for a few moments, then аsked:\n\n\"Did you get the same impression when you looked our CEO friend in the eye?\"\n\nEffie raised an eyebrow, thought about it, and then slowly shook her head.\n\n\"Sort of? Not really. At least not in the same way.\"\n\nSunny exhaled slowly.\n\nHe would have never suspected something like that before meeting Mordret here in Mirage City, but now, an entirely nеw possibility suddenly emerged out of nowhere, making him question everything.\n\n\"Do you remember what Mordret said in the Third Nightmare?\"\n\nEffie blinked a couple of times.\n\n\"What, you even know about that? Wow. I have not imagined that Neph's pillow talk includes talking about Mordret…\"\n\nSunny gave her a glare.\n\n\"Yes, I do know. And why the hell are you imagining our pillow talk at all?\"\n\nEffie laughed.\n\n\"Anyway, Mordret said a lot of things in the Third Nightmare. What do you mean in particular?\"\n\nSunny turned the wheel to change lanes and avoid a puddle that seemed deep enough to flood the weird explosion engine of his car.\n\n\"His — and Soul Stealer's — Flaw. He said that he did not bring his Flaw along into the Nightmare, because carrying something that perilous around would have been foolish.\"\n\nEffie raised an eyebrow, then nodded.\n\n\"Oh, that? Sure, I remember. You don't hear something like that every day, after all.\"\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"I always assumed that he was either lying or talking about a thing. You know, like in the fairy tales where an evil being separates their death from themselves to become immortal, then hides it in the guise of some mundane item. Like a needle or some such — so, they could only be killed by that needle. But what if Mordret was not talking about a thing? What if…\"\n\nHe fell silent for a few moments, then asked in a hesitant tone:\n\n\"What if he meant a person?\"\n\nEffie opened her eyes wide and stared at him with a confused expression.\n\n\"Wait, are you saying that Mordret's Flaw… is a person?\"\n\nShe blinked a few times.\n\n\"No, wait. You're not just saying that it's a person. You're saying that it's the CEO of the Valor Group. There are… two of that bastard?!\"\n\nOne Prince of Nothing was already one too many. Two of them walking around at the same time... sounded certifiably dreadful.\n\n'But it fits, doesn't it? Damnation!'\n\nSunny did not respond immediately, choosing to keep quiet. Eventually, though, he had to answer.\n\n\"Well, I don't know. But Mordret always had a odd relationship with mirrors and reflections. What if his Flaw is actually his reflection?\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, feeling a chill run down his spine.\n\nSomething else suddenly occurred to him.\n\n'Damn.'\n\n\"Actually, we don't know which one of them is real. What if the Mordret we know is the reflection, instead?\"\n\nMordret had conquered his First Nightmare at twelve. So, he had gained his Flaw at twelve, as well.\n\nIf he had really been broken in two and there were two halves of him walking around the world…\n\nThen one of them had been scorned by the Great Clan Valor, imprisoned for seven long years, then escaped his cage and became the Prince of Nothing they knew.\n\nWhile the other…\n\nThe other would have spent close to two decades in the stunning fantasy created for him by the Great Mirror of the Demon of Imagination. In a place that revolved entirely around him, where all his wishes would have come true...\n\nIn Mirage City."

    "content": "2482 Inside Job\n\nBy the time they arrived at the hospital, the rain seemed to have become even heavier. Sunny and Effie jogged from the parking lot to the entrance, where groups of workers in yellow raincoats were busy building sandbag barricades around the building. The same was happening in many parts of the city after a flooding warning was issued earlier in the morning, with a small army of volunteers mobilized by the Valor Group.\n\nBefore diving into the dry safety of the hospital's lobby, Sunny looked up at the stormy expanse of the grey sky.\n\nThe heavy sky looked like it would split open at any moment now.\n\n'Ah… I hate water…'\n\nShaking his head, he followed Effie inside.\n\nIt did not take them long to arrive at the VIP ward where Mordret was being treated. The ward — if it could even be called that — resembled a presidential suite in a luxury hotel more than it resembled a patient room. It was definitely much larger than Sunny's entire apartment, furnished with a degree of lavishness few people could ever dream of, let alone experience.\n\nThe man himself was in the process of putting on another immaculately tailored, stylish suit while discussing something with one of his plentiful assistants. There was a small piece of adhesive bandage on Mordret's cheek, as well as a few bruises marring his smooth skin here and there — but other than that, he did not look like someone who had just barely survived a lethal vehicle collision.\n\nIn fact, he looked strangely cheerful.\n\n\"Ah, detectives!\"\n\nNoticing them, Mordret smiled.\n\n\"You are just in time. I am about to be discharged… would you mind following me to the office? We can talk in the car.\"\n\nSunny and Effie glanced at each other, then studied the battered CEO of the Valor Group intently.\n\nThey might have remained silent for a few moments longer than necessary.\n\n\"Ah… yes. No problem.\"\n\nMordret beamed.\n\n\"Wonderful! Then, shall we depart?\"\n\n'What the hell is wrong with him?'\n\nThe CEO of the Valor Group did not feel like Mordret Sunny knew at all. He was too soft, trusting, and... nice. However, he did not seem exactly normal, either.\n\nWhy was he so happy? Even if he had not sustained heavy injuries in the assassination attempt, it was still a traumatic experience. If Sunny was right and this version of Mordret had spent most of his life in Mirage City, then he should not have experienced many brushes with death, let alone with murder and violence. People like that did not usually brim with positive energy after surviving an attempt on their life.\n\n'Perhaps he's just happy to be alive?'\n\nThey followed Mordret back the way they came. As they did, Sunny asked the question that had been tormenting him for the last couple of hours:\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Mordret, but may I ask why you requested my partner and me to be assigned to your case?\"\n\nMordret glanced at him with a smile.\n\n\"Why? Well… I guess you've made an impression?\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"You should know that you are a suspect in another case we are investigating. Needless to say, there is somewhat of a conflict of interest… not to mention that a person of your status would usually feel offended by two detectives interrogating them. Considering the vast resources at your disposal, we are not exactly the best choice, are we?\"\n\nMordret looked at him with a hint of amusement in his strange mirror-like eyes.\n\n\"On the contrary, Detective. That makes you the best choice.\"\n\nEffie chuckled.\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\nAs they entered the elevator, Mordret gave his entourage a nod to stay behind. With only the three of them in the cabin, he said calmly:\n\n\"It is not simple to assassinate someone like me. My security is quite thorough… and yet, someone ambushed my car on the bridge. At the very least, they had to have known the route I was taking, as well as my destination. Which means that my schedule had been leaked. More than that, I changed it on a whim just that morning. So, whoever leaked my schedule has to be quite close to me — a person in my inner circle, most likely.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, then sighed.\n\n\"And while I don't want to brag, I have to point out that the Valor Group has no competitors. We are too vast and powerful to have enemies… so, there is a high chance that this assassination was ordered by someone within the company. You have already demonstrated your willingness to ignore the pressure exerted by the higher-ups of the Valor Group — very few people would. So, you see, that makes you two the best candidates to investigate this case.\"\n\nSunny stared at Mordret with a strange expression.\n\nThe young CEO was making a lot of sense… but there also seemed to be something off about his logic.\n\nInvеstigating the assassination attempt would give Sunny easy access to Mordret and the inner workings of the Valor Group, though, so he was not going to refuse… not that the Captain had given them an option to refuse.\n\n\"So, basically, what you are saying is that we are the only two cops in Mirage City that you know for a fact can't be bought?\"\n\nMordret coughed.\n\n\"I… wouldn't personally put it quite that way. I am sure there are countless honest and trustworthy people in the Mirage City Police Department. It is just that I do not know them personally.\"\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n\"If you say so.\"\n\nThey arrived at the lobby of the hospital, where another part of Mordret's entourage was already waiting. Three umbrellas were opened to protect him, Sunny, and Effie from the rain, and they were led to a luxurious PTV in a private parking lot — different from the one destroyed in the crаsh, but similarly lavish and stunning.\n\nMordret turned.\n\n\"You must have arrived in a car of your own. I wouldn't want to inconvenience you, so let me ask my driver to… oh.\"\n\nHe froze for a moment, a hint of a mournful expression appearing on his face.\n\nSunny glanced at the file he had retrieved from the hospital administration before coming to see Mordret.\n\n\"I am sorry for your loss. I heard that he passed away in the operating room.\"\n\nMordret remained silent for a few moments, then nodded.\n\n\"Yes. I've been told that he did.\"\n\nHis personal assistant took the driver's seat, while Mordret, Sunny, and Effie entered the passenger compartment.\n\nLowering himself on a soft leather cushion, Sunny looked around with a strange expression.\n\n'What the hell?'\n\nHe had assumed that all archaic PTVs were like his pitiful rust bucket.\n\nBut Mordet had been moving around in this palace on wheels this whole time?!\n\nNo… it was merely his backup palace on wheels.\n\nSunny blinked a few times.\n\nThe ancient times held many secrets…"

    "content": "2483 Internal Strife\n\nSunny studied the luxurious interior of Mordret's opulent PTV, feeling a little… no, he was definitely not envious. Not at all!\n\n'Whatever. There's no mobile command center or essence converter here… bah! There's no bed, even. What a peasant.'\n\nHe cleared his throat and opened a notebook.\n\n\"So, Mr. Mordret, would you tell us what happened?\"\n\nMordret checked his seat belt, then leaned back and sighed.\n\nAn opaque screen rose at a press of a button, separating the passenger compartment from the driver's cabin.\n\n\"Well… there is not much to tell, really. That truck suddenly turned, brushed against the escort vehicle, then crashed into my car and continued pushing until we both went through the railing and fell into the river. By the time I came around, water was already streaming inside, and my driver was unconscious. So, I grabbed him and swam to shore.\"\n\nSunny pretended to note something with his pen.\n\n\"And then what happened?\"\n\nMordret shrugged.\n\n\"Then? Nothing, I guess? My security arrived first, then the ambulances. I was taken to the hospital, and here we are.\"\n\nSunny and Effie glanced at each other.\n\nHe lingered for a moment, then asked in a neutral tone:\n\n\"The last time we spoke, you mentioned that your blood could have been planted on the crime scene, and that there are many people who would wish you ill. The next day, there was an attempt on your life. Do things like that happen to you often, Mr. Mordret?\"\n\nMordret shook his head.\n\n\"No… this is the first time, actually.\"\n\nSunny studied him for a moment.\n\n\"Did you not say that your sister tried to harm you?\"\n\nMordret's expression darkened.\n\n\"That was an entirely different issue. Morgan was just… confused. She was not herself.\"\n\n'Not herself…'\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"I sеe. Well, in any cаse, you indicated that someone inside the Valor Group might be behind the attempt on your life. Do you have anyone particular in mind?\"\n\nMordret shook his head again.\n\n\"Not really.\"\n\n'That's not helpful at all.'\n\nEffie, who had been enthralled by the snacks in the lavishly stocked bar of the PTV, finally joined the conversation — leaning forward a little, she asked with a smile:\n\n\"Let us put it that way — who would benefit the most if you were removed from your position? Who would gain the most?\"\n\nMordret remained silent for a few seconds before saying in a hesitant tone:\n\n\"I guess… it would be the chairman of the board? He and I clash often regarding various issues. His vision of what the Valor Group is supposed to be is different from mine. And unless my father decides to come back from retirement, he would be the logical choice for the next CEO in case I vanish one day.\"\n\nNoticing a sharp glint in their eyes, Mordret laughed and raised his hands.\n\n\"Oh, but please don't misunderstand. It could not have been him. The chairman… he's my uncle, you see. I know what is being said about us conglomerate families, but we are not like that at all. He would never do anything to hurt me.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Your uncle? Mr. Madoc, I presume?\"\n\nMordret nodded.\n\n\"The one and only. He is my father's older brother.\"\n\n'How… morbid.'\n\nWhispering Blade was dead in the real world, but his reflection was still alive and well in Mirage City. Not only that, but just like his real self, he had lost the battle of succession to his younger brother… and then, to his nephew as well.\n\nThe picture practically drew itself. An affluent family, a power-hungry uncle, a conspiracy to steal control оf the family business from the young prince…\n\n\"Well, Mr. Mordret… you might be sure that your uncle would never conspire against you, but as detectives, we must investigate all possibilities. So, if you don't mind, we would like to interview him — as well as a number of other people in your immediate circle. The staff of your manor, for example.\"\n\nMordret nodded.\n\n\"By all means. I hope we can get to the bottom of this unfortunate incident. Ah… but it will take some time to arrange all the interviews. Maybe we can start tomorrow?\"\n\nSunny and Effie asked a few more questions, slowly drawing the picture of the internal politics of the Valor Group.\n\nThey subtly tested Mordret to see who he really was, as well.\n\nSome time later, the PTV arrived at its destination. Mordret smiled apologetically.\n\n\"If you'll excuse me now, detectives — I have already been absent for too long, so there's a mountain of paperwork awaiting me. I will ask my… my new driver to drive you back.\"\n\nHe made to leave, then hesitated for a few seconds and chuckled.\n\n\"Oh… I have a request. If it's not too forward, Detective Athena, may I ask for your autograph?\"\n\nHe picked up an exquisite round coaster and offered it to her along with a pen that seemed to be more expensive than everything the two detectives owned put together.\n\nHis slightly shy smile was quite charming.\n\n\"In honor of your famous discus throw that brought Mirage City the golden medal.\"\n\nEffie took the pen, lingered for a while, then laughed and signed it. \"I can't believe that the CEO of the Valor Group is my fan. How strange… I'll have to tell my husband!\"\n\nTaking the coaster, Mordret flashed them another smile.\n\n\"Then, if you'll excuse me.\"\n\nWith that, he left.\n\nThe ride back was spent in silence. Since the interview with Chairman Madoc and other employees of the Valor Group was scheduled for tomorrow, Sunny and Effie had to do a lot of research — so, they were buried in their communicators, studying everything there was to study on the network.\n\nThe sandbag barricade around the hospital had grown a little taller in their absence. Climbing back into Sunny's car after experiencing the luxury of Mordret's palatial PTV felt like a letdown, but neither of them really cared.\n\nAs soon as they were alone, their expressions changed.\n\nSunny looked at Effie and raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"So, what do you think?\"\n\nShe pulled out the snacks she had pilfered from Mordret's car and smiled darkly.\n\n\"He seems nice. I am entirely sure that he is not… our… Mordret.\"\n\nSending a handful of honey-glazed almonds into her mouth, Effie chewed them happily and added:\n\n\"I am also sure that the bastard is lying.\""

    "content": "2484 Nature Versus Nurture\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"Well, obviously.\"\n\nOpening the preliminary autopsy report of Mordret's dead driver, he shook his head.\n\n\"The reρort says that he died from the injuries received in the crash, and Mordret's retelling of the events corroborates that. It is weird, though… I have not heard of vehicle crashes that leave knife wounds behind.\"\n\nA human body could be torn and broken in all kinds of ways during a high-speed collision, but Sunny had seen countless stab wounds — most of them, he had delivered themselves. So, he would never mistake a wound delivered by a sharp blade for anything else.\n\nEven if the driver's body had been pierced by metal debris, the shape of the wounds would have been different. The edges of the cuts would have been different, as well — so, the chances of these ones appearing on the body of course were close to zero.\n\nSomething had happened between the second the car fell into the water and the moment Mordret and his dying driver were found on the shore of the river.\n\nWhich meant that Mordret had lied to them.\n\nEffie nodded.\n\n\"Someone killed that man, and Mordret is covering for that someone.\"\n\nShe lingered for a moment, then sighed.\n\n\"Also… I think that your theory was true.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Because of that discus thing?\"\n\nEffie nodded again.\n\n\"Yes. I wasn't sure at first, but after rummaging in my counterpart's memories, it is obvious. That guy might not be the Mordret we know, but he was testing us. She won many medals, but her most famous win was a record-breaking spear throw, not a discus throw. She actually messed up while throwing the latter — she gripped the discus so hard that it cracked and fell apart in the air. It was a pretty lackluster performance.\"\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"He was definitely testing us, but what was he trying to find out?\"\n\nEffie looked at him somberly.\n\n\"Whether or not I am the real Detective Athena, I presume.\"\n\nSunny exhaled slowly.\n\n\"Which means that he's aware that someone could have taken her place. Which, in turn… means that he remembers the outside world.\"\n\nEffie chucklеd.\n\n\"That is why he did not react in any way when I told him to snap out of it. It was not that my authority had no effect on him — it's just that he had always known the truth, so there was nothing for him to snap out of.\"\n\nSunny rubbed his face tiredly.\n\n\"There really are two of him. Damna… huh? Wait, you ate all of that, already?\"\n\nThere was now a pile of empty snack packets on the floor of his car. Sunny's eye twitched. \"And why are you throwing them on the floor?! My PTV might be a scrap heap, but it is not a trash heap! Pick them up immediately!\"\n\nEffie coughed a few times, then picked the packets up and rolled them into a ball.\n\n\"These morsels were pretty sweet, by the way! Oh… sоrry for not leaving you any…\"\n\nSunny glared at her.\n\n\"Whatever… I'll forgive you this time. Only a sick lunatic like you would eat something covered in honey, anyway.\"\n\nHe shivered.\n\nEffie laughed.\n\n\"How about we go back to that diner and eat something? It's on me, partner.\"\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"Sure. Spending illusory money to treat me to an illusory meal… how generous of you.\"\n\nSoon enough, they found themselves in the familiar decrepit diner. The food was just as delicious as it was the previous time, though — neither Sunny nor Effie was in the mood to discuss serious matters at the moment, so they simply enjoyed it in silence.\n\nEventually, Effie sighed in satisfaction and looked outside.\n\n\"What a turn of events, huh? Makes me wоnder… if I had an evil twin, what would she be doing?\"\n\nShe chuckled and shook her head.\n\n\"Then again, I did have an evil twin for a while, in the Tomb of Ariel. She just went around devouring Nightmare Creatures — and people, I guess.\"\n\nEffie's expression changed.\n\n\"Wait, does that make Soul Steal an evil twin of an evil twin? That's like… double the evil!\"\n\nSunny smiled faintly.\n\n\"I am not sure that it's so simple — that there's a nice and evil version of Mordret. Who knows? Maybe if the Mordret we know grew up in the idyllic Mirage City, he would have been nice too. And if the CEO of the Valor Group experienced everything his other version experienced, he would have become a insane bastard too.\"\n\nEffie shook her head.\n\n\"Nature versus nurture, huh? No… there's definitely something wrong with Mordret — the one from the real world, I mean. He would have been an eerie creep even in Mirage City.\"\n\nShe looked at him with curiosity and asked:\n\n\"What about you, partner? If you had an evil twin, what would he have been doing?\"\n\nSunny smiled.\n\n\"No idea. Who says that I'm not the evil twin?\"\n\nEffie laughed.\n\n\"Oh? Have you done a lot of evil things?\"\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"Did you think that I became a Sovereign by being kind and good to people? I killed those who could not defend themselves, betrayed those who trusted me, and chose myself at every step of the way. Well, sure, I did a lot of good things too — saving the powerless, standing by my allies, and spilling my own blood for the sake of others. I guess it all balances out, in the end.\"\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n\"Nephis and I, we were prepared to sacrifice millions of lives if it meant getting rid of the Sovereigns. Something like that… is exactly the kind of thing I hated the Sovereigns for, you know? So even if I am not evil, I am at least a hypocrite. Oh, coincidentally, hypocrites are what I hate the most.\"\n\nHe laughed at thе irony.\n\n\"I guess an opposite version of me would have been selfless, kind, and honest… and dead because of it, most likely.\"\n\nEffie studied him for a while, then shook her head and smiled.\n\n\"No, stop pretending. I know you're not evil, Shadow Boy.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"Do you? How so?\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"Well, it was what you told us back when Nephis first brought you along, wasn't it? You said that you knew yourself to be a killer, and that you hoped that all the killing you did changed the world into the shape that allowed better people than you to build things. Even if they had to build them on the ruins left in your wake.\"\n\nEffie smiled.\n\n\"I did not show it then, but I was actually quite touched by that speech. I thought… what a nice guy! Inferior to Master Sunless in all regards, of course, but still a catch!\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"Who knew the two were one and the same? It's like the best of both worlds. Lord of Shadows in the streets, Master Sunless in the…\"\n\nSunny threw a napkin at her.\n\n\"Cut it out, damn it…\""

    "content": "2485 Hardest Part\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, then sighed.\n\nHe wanted to drink something with more bite than water… coincidentally, a familiar green palisade of soju bottles was looking at him invitingly from a nearby display, begging to be bought.\n\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n\n'Since when do I crave alcohol?'\n\nSunny had avoided alcohol entirely for mаny years after the Forgotten Shore. He only allowed himself to enjoy it from time to time now because his Rank made him all but immune to intoxication — so, he could enjoy an occasional glass of wine without suffering the consequences of imbibing it.\n\nBut at the moment, as a mundane person, he once again wanted to stay as far away from alcohol as possible. It was just that the Devil Detective's body, it seemed, had its own opinion.\n\n…Maybe he was someone's better twin, after all.\n\nLooking away from the soju bottles, Sunny glanced at Effie.\n\n\"Lord of Shadows, Master Sunless… and the rest of me. I'd think that if anyone could understand my double life, it would be you.\"\n\nShe arched her eyebrow.\n\n\"Me? I'm an open boоk, though. How come?\"\n\nSunny shrugged.\n\n\"Well, everyone else is doing just one thing. Nephis, Cassie, Kai, Jet, me… we are all at war, and we live and breathe that war. But ironically, the War Beast herself — you — is a warrior, a wife, and a mother. Waging war and playing house are two different things, two different lives. Not that there is wrong with that, just… seems strange, to me.\"\n\nEffie stared at him for a few moments, then laughed.\n\n\"Gods. Aren't you something… what is wrong with both being a warrior and having a life? I didn't invent it, you know. People have been doing just that since the dawn of time. War, plague, famine, the Spell — nothing has ever managed to stop us humans from forming families and making babies. That is our nature. If anything, it is you guys who are weird.\"\n\nSunny scoffed.\n\n\"I already said that there is nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nEffie remained silent for a bit, then sighed.\n\n\"I'll admit, though… it's not easy. Being away for long stretches of time is not easy. Not knowing whether I'll get to come back is not easy. Thinking about what will happen if I do not is… hard. Walking out of the doоr and leaving them behind, though, that's probably the hardest.\"\n\nShe looked out the window.\n\n\"To the point that, sometimes, I feel like I am not brave enough to open the door and leave. But I always do.\"\n\nEffie looked back at Sunny and shrugged with a smile.\n\n\"A part of me always stays behind, though. Who cares if it's hard? Life isn't supposed to be easy, anyway. At least it has never been for me. However, it's pretty sweet — sweeter than I ever imagined it could be. I bet you can understand what I mean.\"\n\nShe laughed, and Sunny could not help but smile, too.\n\nIndeed… the life he was living, despite all its hardships, was much sweeter than anything a lonely kid in the outskirts could have ever imagined.\n\nBut it wasn't quite as sweet as he wanted it to be, just yet.\n\nAnd to take the next step toward achieving his goals, Sunny needed to get to the bottom of Mirage City. He had to catch the Nihilist, learn what Mordret was hiding, recover the fragment of Weaver's Lineage, and escape.\n\nLooking at the watch, Sunny pushed the empty plate away and rose.\n\n\"Sweet life, huh? That's you hinting that I should buy dessert, isn't it?\"\n\nEffie grinned.\n\n\"I mean… if you insist…\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"Shameless… didn't you say that you'll pay the bill, this time?\"\n\nThey did end up buying dessert. Not only because Effie's stomach was a bottomless pit, but also because Sunny was curious about the baking arts of the bygone era. From what he had glimpsed so far, ancient cuisine was superior to what he was familiar with not only in terms of ingredient variety, but also in terms of nuance and technique.\n\nThe Brilliant Emporium might have closed its doors, but Sunny still hoped to reopen it again, one day. In the meantime, he was determined to perfect his culinary skills.\n\nSome time later, he said goodbuy to Effie and drove home. After spending some time in the evening traffic, he ended up back at the Devil Detective's shabby apartment complex. The familiar drunk was once again loitering near the building, but got scared away when Sunny's car pulled up. The heavy curtain of rain veiled the world and suppressed the sounds, making his paranoia act up.\n\nSunny wondered briefly if it was his own paranoia or the remnant wariness of his counterpart.\n\nEntering the apartment, he shook the water from his jacket and went about taking care of his fragile, weak mundane body. This body needed a lot of things to survive and function properly, and what it needed the most was sleep — the interviews with Mordret's staff were going to start early tomorrow, so Sunny needed to give himself enough time to rest.\n\nJust before climbing into bed, he stopped and stared at the investigation map at the back of the Devil Detective's closet. The shape of the city, the evidence, the victims of the Nihilist — Mordret's former vessels…\n\nTurning away, Sunny turned off the light and lay on the bed. The sound of the rain on the window was like a lullaby, but sleep still escaped him for a long time.\n\nWhen he finally slipped into its embrace, his dreams were cold and restless, full of mirrors and breaking glass.\n\nThe sound of breaking glass…\n\nSunny opened his eyes abruptly, the sound still ringing in his ears.\n\n'The bottle.'\n\nThe bottle that he had balanced on the door handle, following the Devil Detective's paranoid habit, was broken.\n\nBlinded by the darkness, Sunny rolled to the side.\n\nIn the next moment, a cold blade hissed as it cut the air, and then plunged into his pillow, missing his head only by a few centimeters."

However, he could not sense the shadows. Even more humiliating, he could not even see in the dark — for the first time in a long while, Sunny was truly blind.\n\nThe only light in the room came through a narrow crack between the curtains, and all he could see was a dark shape jumping over the bed.\n\nHe could, however, smell wet wool, old sweat, and the stench of alcohol.\n\n'The... the damned drunk!'\n\nHe knew it!\n\nParanoia had never let him down, after all…\n\nSunny was laying on the floor in an awkward pose, while the attacker was on the bed, a split second away from coming down with the deadly blade in his hand — it was a mundane knife, but here in Mirage City, even a mundane blade had the power to make Sunny bleed.\n\nIt had the power to make him die.\n\nHis senses were gone, his Aspect was gone… however, his skill and experience were still with him. Sunny did not possess the power of a Sovereign anymore, but he was still the person who had become a Sovereign.\n\nAnd that was his most frightening quality, by far — a strength far more impоrtant than his Aspect, Attributes, and Domain had ever been.\n\nInstead of trying to rise, Sunny kicked the cheap bed with all his might. It slid half a meter back, throwing the moving attacker off balance — the dark silhouette swayed and fell, crashing into the floor.\n\nThere was the sound of empty bottles breaking, and glass shards were suddenly everywhere.\n\nGгabbing a curtain, Sunny pulled it down while jumping to his feet. The shoddily attached curtain pole snapped, and the cold light of electric street lights poured into the small apartment.\n\nHis pale skin, lean muscles, and the coils of the black serpent tattooed across his body were revealed in that light.\n\nThe eerie, glassy eyes of the supposed drunk were revealed, too.\n\nSunny looked at him with a calm, cold gaze of a seasoned killer.\n\n\"You have some nerve, coming after a cop. Who sent you?\"\n\nInstead of answering, the drunk lunged forward.\n\nThe man looked like a drunk and smelled like a drunk… but he moved with the speed and deadly precision of a trained assassin.\n\n'Assassins, huh? That is a new one…'\n\nThere weren't any professional assassins left in the real world. There were consummate slayers proficient in killing quietly, sure, but who had time to specialize in assassinating people when there were hordes of Nightmare Creatures roaming both the Dream Realm and Earth? There was no stable employment in that, so even for those who did do such work, it was merely a part-time job.\n\nSunny had envisioned himself as one such quiet killer once, though, so he felt a little resentful of the man who had entered his apartment to end his life.\n\nCatching the man's wrist, Sunny turned, isolating the enemy's arm between his own and his torso, then slammed the palm of his other hand into the killer's fist. The knife rattled as it fell on the floor, and he immediately spun, tensing his abdominal muscles — and not a second too soon.\n\nThe assassin's fist crashed into the steel barrier of his muscles, and at the same time, Sunny's elbow caught the man in the side of the head.\n\nDisoriented, the man staggered toward the window and turned, shielding his head with one arm.\n\nThe other reached toward his belt and pulled out a strange contraption. It had a short stubby barrel and a revolving cylinder protruding from the middle of its metal frame, with a ring protecting the assassin's index finger, but not the rest of them.\n\n'That's… an ancient gun.'\n\nAn average Awakened might not know a lot about firearms, but Sunny had led mundane soldiers across the frigid expanse of Antarctica.\n\nHe had also grown up in the outskirts, so he knew a gun when he saw one, even if it was an archaic relic that belonged in a museum.\n\nSunny looked at the killer with a dark expression.\n\n'Who brings a gun to a fistfight? That's cheating.'\n\nBefore the assassin could raise the gun and point it forward, Sunny raised his leg and delivered a devastating push kick to the middle of the man's sternum.\n\nIt was powerful enough to shatter ribs — but more importantly, it was powerful enough to throw the bastard far back.\n\nAnd behind him… was the window.\n\nThe assassin shattered the glass with his back and tumbled over the parapet, letting in the noise of the rain and the chilly wind.\n\nHe fell down surrounded by sharp shards, leaving the same way he had come — accompanied by the sound of breaking glass.\n\n'...Which floor do I leave on, again?'\n\nSunny approached the broken window and looked down.\n\nThe body sprawled on the wet asphalt far below was still moving. The man shuddered, then climbed to his feet slowly and staggered away, leaving a trail of blood in his wake.\n\n'That bastard.'\n\nThrowing the curtain over the shattered window to avoid cutting himself, Sunny climbed out, grabbed the slippery drain pipe, and nimbly descended to the ground.\n\nThe rain pelted his naked torso, and his wet hair got into his eyes. Worse of all, his black pajama pants were swiftly absorbing water.\n\nSunny followed the trail of blood to a fence a dozen metres away. A random passerby gasped when noticing his tattoo, then hurried away with a terrified expression on their face.\n\nPassing the fence, Sunny just barely saw the wounded assassin disappearing around the corner. There was someone standing at the side of the road, as well, wearing a torn raincoat and an unassuming cap. They were staring at the blood left in the wake of the failed killer.\n\n'Another chance witness. Why aren't all of these people sleeping?'\n\nIn the red neon light of a nearby shop sign, the passerby looked like he was bathed in blood.\n\nSunny walked barefoot across the puddles, then stopped and looked at the chance witness darkly. He looked at Sunny as well…\n\nAnd then smiled with amusement.\n\nSunny could see his pale body reflecting in the ragged man's mirror-like eyes.\n\n\"Ah, what a nice surprise. Fancy seeing you here, Detective. Are you out for a nice evening stroll?\"\n\nSunny smiled darkly.\n\n\"...Cut the crap. I know who you are.\"\n\nMordret — the Prince of Nothing — studied him for a moment, and then chuckled.\n\n\"I know who you are, too.\"\n\nHe smiled pleasantly.\n\n\"You're the man who killed my father.\""

    "content": "2487 Fighting in the Rain\n\nSunny and Mordret face each other in the rain. The trail of blood was slowly being washed off the wet asphalt, and the neon sign kept blinking above them, drowning the street in dim radiance.\n\nMordret's mirror-like eyes seemed to shine with a dark crimson glow as they reflected the world back upon itself. His pleasant smile felt... dangerous.\n\nFeeling a bit hateful was only natural for someone who knew that Sunny had killed their father, even if the source of that hate was somewhat unconventional in this particular case.\n\nSunny looked at Mordret somberly, not showing any sign of being disturbed.\n\nHe loathed to admit it…\n\nBut he was rather cold.\n\n'Damn.'\n\nWhy had he not put on a jacket before jumping out of the window? It was raining outside, and the night was chilly!\n\nPerhaps it was because he had grown unused to being bothered by the weather.\n\nLooking Mordret in the eye, Sunny grinned.\n\n\"Why? Jealous?\"\n\nMordret's dangerous smile slowly widened.\n\nRaising his head, he laughed.\n\n\"Jealous? Ah… no, not quite. Jealousy is not the word I would use.\"\n\nTaking off his cap, he allowed the rain to pelt his tousled black hair for a moment, then swept it back and pierced Sunny with a cold, eerie gaze.\n\nThe neon sign blinked, and for a moment, his mask of pleasant friendliness seemed to crack, revealing a raging ocean of scathing fury and boundless loathing beneath.\n\nBut then, the sign lit up, and Mordret seemed… almost normal again.\n\nHe smiled and shook his head, taking a step to circle Sunny.\n\n\"My, my. I had a feeling that there was something off when the valiant Devil Detective kept popping up near my other self. So, I wanted to make sure that he was indeed who he claimed to be… that question has been answered, I suppose. Imagine my surprise, though, when I saw a man flying through your window while keeping watch. How scandalous!\"\n\nMordret chuckled.\n\n\"Do you often toss people out of the window… Sunless? Was that the name you use? I hope you'll forgive me if I don't address you as the Lord of Shadows. That title is a bit unwieldy.\"\n\nSunny turned slowly, keeping Mordret in his line of sight.\n\n'He sure is in a talkative mood.'\n\nIt seemed that the Prince of Nothing had been staying close to his other self, watching him closely. And if his words were to be believed… he had not sent the killer to get rid of Sunny. Instead, he had simply been investigating a person sticking close to the Valor Group heir when the assassination attempt had taken place. But why was Mordret watching over his other self? What was he doing here in Mirage City? How had his nicer version ended up in the Great Mirror, to begin with?\n\nSunny gave Mordret a cold stare.\n\n\"That is indeed a name I use. Oh, by the way… I have some questions for you. You can answer them the easy way or the hard way. It's your choice.\"\n\nHe smiled darkly.\n\n\"I really hope you choose the hard way, though.\"\n\nMordret studied him for a few moments.\n\n\"You know, Sunless, I always wondered where this animosity you feel toward me stems from. I think I was quite courteous the first time we met, back in Godgrave. Admittedly… I did try to take you as a vessel when you dismissed that eerie mask of yours. But can you really blame me? I mean, you had been provoking me the whole time.\"\n\nSunny shrugged.\n\n\"I can blame you. I do blame you, as it happens.\"\n\nMordret's smile slowly drained from his face. Looking at Sunny with a chilling lack of emotion in his eyes, he said evenly:\n\n\"How regrettable. Who knew there would be an army of abominations hidden in your soul? But, Sunless… you might have noticed that we are mundane here, in Mirage City. Which means that there's no legion of Nightmare Creatures to protect you from me.\"\n\nAt the end there, his voice grew a bit lower, making him sound quite menacing.\n\nSunny was not intimidated, though.\n\nInstead, he grinned.\n\n\"...The hard way it is, then.\"\n\nHe lunged forward, throwing his fist in Mordret's face. Mordret deflected it easily enough, but that attack was merely a feint — a split second later, Sunny unleashed a hurricane of kicks and punches, aiming to bring the Prince of Nothing down.\n\nHe had absorbed countless battle styles for unarmed combat, so fighting with his bare hands was no less familiar to Sunny than wielding lethal weapons. In fact, his hands were deadly weapons in and of themselves.\n\nMordret laughed, evading the barrage of strikes with infuriating ease.\n\n\"Ah… this is great. This is wondeгful! You know, I've grown tired of killing men of powerful combat Aspects while possessing no similar powers myself over the years. This place evens that playing field, though. How refreshing!\"\n\nHe caught Sunny's fist in a vice grip and added in a low tone:\n\n\"I remember you sent me a gift not too long ago, Sunless. Should I return the favor?\"\n\nHe was talking about the Cursed Demon, Abjuration, of course.\n\n'Oops.'\n\nIn the next moment, Sunny found himself on the receiving end of Mordret's fury. The bastard did not lack combat skill by any means, and now that they were both mundane, small things like height and reach mattered much more than usual. On top of that, Sunny was still not used to his altered state.\n\nThe loss of shadow essence, of the [Feather of Truth] trait of the Onyx Shell that had become a staple of his battle technique, and even of his Aspect was not too difficult to adjust to. But it was thе absence of shadow sense that truly made him feel like a cripple.\n\nSunny felt like a blind man.\n\nSo, he found himself nearly defenseless against Mordret's vicious assault.\n\nThe Prince of Nothing battered his defense until it was completely unraveled, then callously sent a devastating punch flying toward Sunny's temple.\n\nSunny knew that he would not be able to evade it, deflect it, or block it.\n\nHe didn't try.\n\nInstead, he turned his head slightly and took the blow straight on.\n\n'Ah… crap…'\n\nDespite Mordret's slender build and refined manners, his fist truly packed a punch.\n\nSunny did not even feel any pain, just found himself suddenly dazed and reeling. He could also feel blood streaming down his face from a cut above his brow.\n\nBut that did not stop him from raising both hands and catching Mordret's wrist.\n\nThe Prince of Nothing frowned.\n\n\"What are you…\"\n\nPulling his enemy off balance, Sunny unceremoniously head-butted him in the face. Mordret staggered back with a stifled curse, blood pouring from his nose. Before he could recover, Sunny pivoted on one foot and delivered a powerful roundhouse kick to the side of his head. No matter how skilled Mordret was, he was still thrown to the ground in a daze.\n\n\"How about I reunite you with your father, bastard?\"\n\nTaking a step forward, Sunny prepared to stomp on Mordret's head and crack his skull.\n\nBut instead, something glinted in the red neon light, and he felt a chill penetrate his flesh, followed by sharp pain.\n\nGrasping his side, Sunny staggered back.\n\nHis pants were already soaked by rain, but now, they were being washed by blood, too.\n\n'That… damn miscreant…'\n\nMordret slowly rose to his feеt, smiling darkly. There was a narrow switchblade in his hand, its pale steel painted red.\n\n'Why is everyone dying to stab me today?!'\n\nSunny let out an infuriated growl.\n\n\"You think a little knife will stop me from killing you?\"\n\nThe growl...seemed to take Mordret aback. Enough so for him to hesitate, at least — instead of trying to stab Sunny, he looked somewhere behind him warily and lowered the switchblade. \"Maybe not. But they will.\"\n\nTurning his torso to see what Mordret was looking at — while still keeping an eye on the bastard — Sunny saw a few silhouettes looming in the windows of his apartment complex.\n\nHe could not discern their features, but his neighbors were all eerily motionless, still, all staring down at him with glassy eyes.\n\nDozens of them.\n\nMordret smiled faintly.\n\n\"Detective Sunless… I suggest you stop behaving erratically.\"\n\nHis smile faded quickly, though.\n\n\"Unless you want to become the next victim of the Nihilist, that is.\""

    "content": "2488 Castellan\n\n'The Nihilist?'\n\nWhat did Mordret mean?\n\nThe laceration on Sunny's forehead and the cut on his abdomen stung, but he was much more uncomfortable because of the motionless figures staring at him with empty eyes from the windows.\n\nHe knew what was happening.\n\nJust like Effie's family had reacted to her acting out of character, so were Sunny's neighbors unsettled by his fight with Mordret. Something about it was not in character for the Devil Detective, and the Others inhabiting Mirage City were unhappy about it.\n\nSunny did not know what would happen if he continued to attack the Prince of Nothing, and suspected that he would not want to find out.\n\nBut what did it have to do with the Nihilist?\n\nFrowning, Sunny looked at Mordret and asked:\n\n\"Aren't you the Nihilist?\"\n\nHe knew by now that Mordret was not the serial killer terrorising Mirage City — instead, he was the target of the serial killer. However, there was no point in revealing his cards to the Prince of Nothing. Rather, Sunny wanted to learn a thing or two from how he would react.\n\nWiping the blood off his lips, Mordret smiled.\n\n\"No need to play coy. The fact that you seem to remember yourself means that Raised by Wolves is here, too. And she would have recognized the faces of my vessels, given time. So, you know that I am not the Nihilist.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"If not you, then who? Your other self?\"\n\nMordretlaughed.\n\n\"That pathetic creature? Goodness, no. He's too useless to kill anyone.\"\n\n'Not a fan of his good twin, then.'\n\nSunny grimaced.\n\n\"So who is going around massacring people?\"\n\nMordret stared at him for a few moments, then leaned down to pick up his cap.\n\n\"Why should I answer? It would be foolish to share information with someone who is here to kill me.\"\n\nSunny blinked a couple of times.\n\n'Here… to kill him?'\n\nHis mind spun at high speed.\n\nNo… it made sense. Mordret did not know about the fragment of Weaver's Lineage hidden in the Great Mirror — so, he would not know that Sunny had come to retrieve it. Why would Sunny have come, then?\n\nThe only reasonable explanation was that he had followed Mordret and Morgan inside. And since Mordret could actually be killed here — at least according to Morgan — he would naturally assume that the only reason for the Lord of Shadows to visit Mirage City was to hunt him down.\n\nBut that wasn't Sunny's goal.\n\nKilling Mordret was just a delightful bonus.\n\nHe scoffed.\n\n\"Aren't you too full of yourself? Why would I waste my time and risk my life trying to kill you? My arrival at Mirage City had nothing to do with you, your better half, or even your sister. In fact, I'd prefer it if none of you were here.\"\n\nMordret remained silent for a moment, then threw an uneasy look at the figures looming in the windows.\n\nCome to think of it… he looked a little haggard. It was especially noticeable after spending some time in the company of the glamorous CEO of the Valor Group — this Mordret's face was gaunt, sharp, and burdened in comparison.\n\nIt seemed like surviving in the Great Mirror was not simple for the Prince of Nothing.\n\nMorddret looked back at Sunny, considered something for a second, and then offered him his usual pleasant smile.\n\n\"It is hard to believe… but sadly, there is not much time for us to continue this polite conversation. Sure, why not? I will tell you about the Nihilist.\"\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n\"I am not the Nihilist… and neither is my other self. Nevertheless, you will have great trouble catching this particular killer, Detective.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"And why is that?\"\n\nMordret's eyes ignited with an ominous vermilion glow under the light of the neon sign.\n\n\"You really don't know? Ah… well, you have not been here long.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes for a moment, then said in a pleasant tone:\n\n\"That is because the Nihilist is nobody in particular. The killer you are searching for... is Mirage City itself. This entire city is the killer.\"\n\nSunny's eyes widened a little.\n\n'That…'\n\nHe couldn't help but shiver.\n\n\"What the hell do you mean?\"\n\nMordret smiled and nodded to the figures looming in the windows subtly.\n\n\"It's just like I said. There is not a single killer walking around searching for prey. Instead, any random passerby can become the Nihilist for a period of time, slaughter their victim, then turn back to normal. Or rather… I should say that there was not a single killeг. There may very well be one now.\"\n\nHis words were making less and less sense. Sunny scowled, then asked in a frustrated tone:\n\n\"Once again, what the hell do you mean? Why would there be an actual Nihilist now, even if there was not one before?\"\n\nGlancing at the apartment complex, Sunny froze.\n\nThat was because there were no figures in the windows anymore. All of them had disappeared, and the building seemed empty.\n\nAs if the people who had been staring at him had either lost interest...\n\nOr were walking out of their apartments and descending the stairs to reach him, instead.\n\nMordret slowly backed away.\n\n\"How do you think this place works, Sunless? \"\n\nHe smiled darkly.\n\n\"In theory, it should be controlled by the master of Bastion. But the Great Mirror has stood abandoned for too long… the sorcery governing it has become twisted and corrupted over the eons.\"\n\nPutting on his cap, Mordret hid the bloodied switchblade in his pocket.\n\n\"Or rather, the custodian Mirage left behind to take care of her palace has become twisted. A very special reflection among reflections… the Castellan. It was supposed to help the Master of the Castle control the Great Mirror, but at some point, it broke.\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"Now, the poor thing doesn't know what to do. It refuses to recognize anyone as the Master of the Castle, but it still tries to fulfill its duty. That is why it created Mirage City when my other self became a guest of the Great Mirror. This place is meant to fulfill his fantasies, after all.\"\n\nMordret laughed.\n\n\"But, Sunless… what happens when more guests arrive? What happens when Morgan imagines killing her brother? What happens when you keep thinking about catching the Nihilist? What happens… when all these dreams collide and start conflicting with each other?\"\n\nHis smile widened a little, turning dark and sinister.\n\n\"The Palace of Imagination will attempt to protect itself by removing the contaminating influences. It will correct Mirage City in a way that creates a believable reason for you to die. Look, it is already happening… someone has sent an assassin to get rid of you, after all. Who knows, maybe a real Nihilist has already been created, as well, as if he has always existed.\"\n\nAs Sunny grimaced, blood still flowing from his cut abdomen, Mordret chuckled and turned to dash into an alley.\n\n\"Oh, and by the way…\"\n\nHe paused for a moment and gave Sunny a pitying look.\n\n\"You won't be the only one Mirage City tries to remove. So, if you brought other people with you… well, anyway, I'd go give Raised by Wolves a call.\"\n\nA second later, he was gone, dissolved into the curtain of Rain.\n\nSunny did not follow.\n\nLeft alone in the ominous light of the red neon sign, hе shivered. Then, his eyes widened suddenly.\n\nEffie knew who she was, so he wasn't too worried about her.\n\nHowever…\n\n'Saint!'"

    "content": "2489 Pursuit of Balance\n\n\"Miss Morgan? Can you hear me?\"\n\nSaint sighed.\n\nThe woman in front of her was not responding. She was strapped into a straitjacket, sitting in a wheelchair, and looking quietly into the barred window of her patient room with an absent expression on her pale face.\n\nThe world outside the window was dark. It was already late into the night, far past the time Saint was supposed to get off work. Her schedule was in shambles… which was a point of intense frustration. However, she could not do anything about it — this particular patient gave a whole new meaning to the word VIP, so Saint had been assigned to her and ordered to get to the bottom of her condition with utmost haste.\n\nShe had been spending a lot of time with this patient as of late, but things were not going well. That hurt her pride.\n\nMiss Morgan… was a difficult puzzle.\n\nShe was both unhinged and chillingly cunning at times, and worse than that, she was prone to violent episodes. Worst of all, though, was the fact that this seemingly delicate woman somehow managed to deliver eerily gruesome wounds to the orderlies each time they tried to restrain her. Several had already been hospitalized, some of them irreversibly maimed and crippled.\n\nTherefore, Miss Morgan was put in a straitjacket and regularly fed a cocktail of powerful neuroleptics, which curbed some of her violent behavior, but made Saint's work much more difficult.\n\nAfter all, how was she supposed to have a conversation with a person who had been drugged out of their mind?\n\nIt was almost as if the leadership of the hospital had no intention of helping this patient, and was perfectly content simply keeping her locked up.\n\nLetting out another sigh, Saint left a note in her journal and stood to leave.\n\n\"I will see you tomorrow, then.\"\n\nShe was almost to the door when Morgan suddenly spoke — it was the first sentence she had spoken today, making Saint stop.\n\n\"You… something is different about you today.\"\n\nSaint lingered for a moment, then turned around.\n\nShe did not say anything, studying her patient silently.\n\nMorgan studied her, as well.\n\n…Why did it seem like her eуes had a scarlet glint to them?\n\nNaturally, it was impossible. Iris pigmentation was determined by the melanin saturation level and varied from brown or dark brown, which could appear black in certain lighting, to lighter shades like green, blue, and grey. In rare cases, such as albinism, melanin was entirely absent, which exposed blood vessels behind the iris and gave the eyes a pale reddish tint.\n\nHowever, there were no people with vibrant, vivid vermilion eyes.\n\nSaint frowned subtly.\n\n'I must have seen wrong.'\n\nMorgan, meanwhile, smiled slowly.\n\n\"You are... real, aren't you? But how strange. I don't recognize you. Well, no matter — since you arrived with that man, you must be one of his.\"\n\nShe seemed to be delirious, talking nonsense. In fact, considering the amount of antipsychotic medications administered to this patient, it was a miracle that she was able to form coherent sentences at all.\n\nMorgan's smile did not seem like that of a person heavily dosed with tranquilizers, though.\n\nShe chuckled.\n\n\"Tell him to come see me.\"\n\nShe looked at something behind Saint, then exhaled slowly.\n\n\"...Then again, maybe I'll come see him myself.\"\n\nWith thаt, she turned to look out the window with an absent expression once again. The brief moment of lucidity seemed to have come to an end.\n\nSaint remained silent for a few moments, then turned around and left the room. The padded steel door locked behind her with a loud click.\n\n'Her condition seemed to have worsened. I must make them change her prescriptions at all costs.'\n\nAn unfamiliar nurse and a few orderlies were loitering in the corridor outside. She did not recognize any of them, which would have been strange on a usual day… there had been many new hires as of late, though, precisely because of the patient in the room behind her. Saint had not memorized their faces just yet.\n\nStill, the fact that they were new did not mean that there was an excuse for how poorly they were carrying out their duties.\n\nSaint frowned, then forced herself to speak:\n\n\"Do you know what time it is? Why hasn't anyone helped the patient to bed уet? Were you planning to keep her in that wheelchair the entire night?\"\n\nOne of the orderlies looked down.\n\n\"Sorry, doctor. We will strap her in right now.\"\n\nShaking her head slightly, Saint left them behind.\n\nHer schedule was already a mess, but if there was one thing she could not compromise on, it was proper sleep. Sleep was a cornerstone of both physical and mental health, so Saint maintained a healthy sleep cycle meticulously. She had to clock out and return home swiftly.\n\nSoon enough, Saint left the hospital building, opened an umbrella, and headed to where her car was parked. She looked at the phone while walking to check the time and noticed a dozen missed calls from a certain number. Detective Sunless seemed not to have taken her warning seriously.\n\nPursing her lips, Saint blocked his number and put her phone away, retrieving the car key instead. Approaching her car, she exhaled slowly and looked up.\n\nThe hospital was situated on the outskirts of the city, in the prestigious northern suburbs. So, the view would have been quite picturesque on a normal day — sadly, the world was veiled by rain, and the stars were obscured by the heavy mass of storm clouds.\n\nThe only bright lights Saint could see were the spotlights on the immense dam towering above the city in the north. Behind it was one of the three great lakes of Mirage City — due to the heavy rainfall, its levels had risen, so the floodgates of the recently renovated dam were open.\n\nSaint could hear the hum of falling water even from a distance. That water would feed the main lake — the Mirror Lake — and if that was not enough, the floodgates of the southern dam would be open as well to alleviate the pressure.\n\nThat was how Mirage City, built around a system of three artificial lakes, avoided drowning during the storm season. It remained safe and sound by maintaining balance, гeleasing pressure when needed, and letting the water flow between the three lakes.\n\nAll systems pursued balance above everything else, after all. That was their nature.\n\nA human mind was much the same. It needed balance to stay healthy… all disorders originated from instability and imbalance.\n\nSaint wondered what Miss Morgan's imbalance was. What was there that she, who had everything in the world at her fingertips, lacked? Or was that exactly the root of the problem…\n\nThe fact that she had too much.\n\nShaking her head, Saint raised the key to unlock her car.\n\nIt was then that she sensed movement behind her, and suddenly, there was something sharp and thin wrapped around her neck."

    "title": "2490 Heal Thyself.docx",
    "content": "2490 Heal Thyself\n\n'I am being strangled.'\n\nSaint found herself strangely calm despite the fact that someone had wrapped a garrotte around her neck, as if situations like this were nothing new to her — familiar and trifling, rather.\n\nShe noted the strangeness of her reaction and filed it away to be analyzed later, reаsonably assessing that now was not the time for self-reflection.\n\nHer instincts kicked in, proving that countless hours of training had not been in vain. Before Saint could even register what was happening, her body moved on its own, and she just barely managed to insert her hand between the cold garrote and her neck before the sharp string drew taut.\n\nThe rain obscured eveгything around, its rustle drowning all the sounds. Light was pouring out of the hospital's windows no more than a hundred metres away, but even if Saint screamed, no one would hear her — not that she could scream with all the pressure being put on her throat.\n\n'Ah…'\n\nThe assailant pulled on the garrote, and Saint suddenly couldn't breathe anymore. The string bit into her fingers, threatening to sever them, and she felt blood flowing down her wrist.\n\nDespite the horror of the situation, Saint felt a pang of annoyance. The sleeve of her trench coat, the blouse beneath… washing out blood stains was going to be such a hassle. The trench coat might survive, considering its hydrophobic coating, but the fabric of the expensive blouse would be positively ruined.\n\nBut then again…\n\nMaybe she would not have to wash her clothes.\n\nBecause she would be dead.\n\n'Somebody is trying to kill me.'\n\nBut who?\n\nA violent robber? A deranged patient? An obsessive stalker?\n\nAnything and everything was possible.\n\nShe could feel his mass behind her, pressing her into into his heavy body and pulling on the garrote with monstrous strength — no matter how much time Saint had spent exercising and honing her body, she would never be able to overpower an opponent who was that much larger, that much heavier, and that much stronger on top of that.\n\n\"Akhhhh…\"\n\nA hoarse, undignified noise escaped from her lips.\n\n'Damnation.'\n\nLeaning against the assailant to support her weight, Saint raised her leg… and slammed the sole of her boot against the door of her car.\n\nNewton's Third Law of Motion — for every action, there was an equal and opposite reactiоn. Saint had unleashed a potent force upon the car, and was pushed in the opposite direction with equal force.\n\nThe car did not move, obviously, but Saint and the man strangling her were thrown back.\n\nHe collided with the next car in the row, denting it, and lost his balance. At the same time, Saint slammed the back of her head into his face.\n\nThe pull on the garrote weakened for a split second, which allowed her to slip free.\n\nSaint rolled away while feverishly gulping air. She did not care about dirtying her clothes in the puddles anymore — all she cared about was being able to breathe once again.\n\nSteadying herself with one arm, she attempted to plan her next actions carefully.\n\n…Everyone had a plan until they got kicked in the face.\n\nSomeone's heavy boot collided with her cheekbone, sending Saint back to the ground. A moment later, a vicious kick landed on her ribs, throwing her into the side of the car.\n\n\"Ah, crap. Hey, dimwit, can't you even handle a girl?\"\n\n\"Shut your mouth! I think she broke my nose, dammit!\"\n\nSaint heard the voices through her daze.\n\n'There are two of them.'\n\nShe gritted her teeth, then used the car for support and slowly rose to her feet.\n\nOne of the two dark figures looked at her with a hint of surprise.\n\n\"Look at that, she stood up. We got a tough one this time, huh?\"\n\nThe second lowered his hand, revealing a bloodied face, and gestured to her angrily.\n\n\"Who cares? Get her!\"\n\nThe first man grinned.\n\n\"Tough ones last longer. I like it.\"\n\nA second later, the blade of a sharp hunting knife glinted in his hand.\n\nSaint stared at the knife with a strange indifference.\n\nShe had learned countless techniques on how to defend herself against an armed opponent.\n\nHowever, every instructor she had ever worked with told her the same thing:\n\n'The best defence against a knife… is to run away.'\n\nRunning away was the optimal solution.\n\nSo, she did exactly that.\n\nTurning around, Saint dashed away.\n\nThe ground was slippery, and her designer boots had heels. Nevertheless, her form and speed were quite impressive — by the time the two assailants reacted, she had already created a bit of distance between them and herself.\n\nThey lunged in pursuit without wasting any time, though.\n\n'Run, run, run…'\n\nSaint wished she could have sprinted toward the hospital, but sadly, the assailants had barred that direction. So, she was running toward the road instead.\n\nSomehow, it felt wrong. Logically, Saint understood that running away from two larger, stronger, better-armed enemies was the right thing to do… but something inside of her rebelled against that idea.\n\nShe wanted to live, though, so she forced that inexplicable feeling down.\n\nBy the time Saint reached the road, the assailants had practically caught up with her. She had hoped that there would be cars passing by, but sadly, the street was dark and empty… no, not quite.\n\nThere was a car parked across the road, and the driver was outside, smoking as he hid the cigarette in his palm to shield it from the rain.\n\nHope!\n\nSaint raised a hand, wishing to call out to the stranger.\n\nBut the words froze on her lips.\n\nPerhaps it was because of his black gloves, or perhaps it was because of the glassy, eerie look in his eyes… but she instinctively knew that the man was not going to help her.\n\nOn the contrary, he was one of the attackers. Their driver, perhaps.\n\n'There are… three of them.'\n\nAnd she was surrounded.\n\nThe smoking man noticed her by then. He frowned, tossed the cigarette away, and lunged across the road, leaving her nowhere to run.\n\n'What do I do?'\n\nSaint froze, feeling a little desperate.\n\n…In the next moment, an old black car appeared out of the rain, sending the third assailant flying over its hood. His body struck the road with a dull thud and remained laying there, broken and motionless, while the car skidded to a stop.\n\nIts door opened, and someone whom Saint had never expected to see climbed out of it.\n\nIt was… the man whose number she had recently blocked, Detective Sunless.\n\nShe stared at her former patient with wide eyes, feeling both relieved and confused to see him.\n\nAnd happy, as if him being there was the most natural thing in the world.\n\nNot quite a guardian angel...\n\nWearing dark clothes and an even darker expression, her personal devil looked behind Saint and scowled.\n\n\"Hey, bastards. Why are you bothering my therapist? Are you two degenerate lowlifes tired of living, or what? If you are, stop wasting everyone's time and come here. I'll kill you.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment and winced.\n\n\"I mean… I'll arrest you? Yeah. That is what I will… no, you know what, I am not going to lie. I'll definitely kill you…\""

    "content": "2491 Keep Calm\n\nThe assailants studied the detective with grim expressions. One of them threw a furtive look at the broken body laying on the wet asphalt; the other showed no concern for the fate of their fallen comrade whatsoever.\n\nInstead, he grinned.\n\n\"Look at that. A prince on a white horse appeared to save the damsel.\"\n\nDetective Sunless shook his head as he walked in their direction.\n\n\"Are you colorblind or something? My car is obviously black. And I am not a prince.\"\n\nHe smiled darkly.\n\n\"I am a king. Well… a sovereign, to be precise.\"\n\nThe assailant laughed.\n\n\"Did you hear that? That was way too funny, man. We have an actual psycho on our hands! One of her patients, I guess.\"\n\nDetective Sunless passed by Saint, who had stood frozen throughout the entire exchange. Now, finally, she shook off her daze and called out to him in a subdued tone:\n\n\"They are armed.\"\n\nHe glanced at her briefly.\n\n\"Of course they are.\"\n\nThere was not a hint of concern in his voice.\n\nThe detective walked past Saint and continued on his way toward the two attackers. She considered whether she was supposed to help him… it seemed only natural to do so, for some reason, to the point that she almost took a step to follow him.\n\nBut then, Saint reminded herself of what she was doing. Fighting armed bandits in the rain was not something an ordinary person like herself was supposed to engage in. She had accepted the frightening situation with an abnormal level of calmness, but actually, a normal person would be terrified and in a panic right now, doing their best to escape.\n\n'Should I escape? No… should I try to find help? Police! Should I call the police?\"\n\nBut the police was already here…\n\nBefore Saint could decide on a course of action, Detective Sunless and the two bandits lunged at each other.\n\nThen, things happened swiftly.\n\nThe one with the knife slashed at the detective's neck, aiming to slit his throat open. The other had produced a telescopic baton out of somewhere and attacked from the other side, bringing it down on the detective's head. They worked well with each other, moving with a shared purpose to leave the victim no way to escape.\n\nDetective Sunless did not try to escape, though.\n\nInstead, he caught the first assailant's wrist and pushed it aside, making the knife miss his neck. At the same time, he lowered his torso and kicked the second assailant in the chest, sending him staggering back.\n\n\"Pathetic… now I am less offended about only warranting one assassin while Saint gets three. My guy was a professional, at least.\"\n\nThe ensuing brawl was short, violent, and bloody. Despite what Detective Sunless had said, the two men fighting him were not amateurs — they were trained, vicious, and clearly accustomed to hurting people.\n\nNevertheless, he handled them with such a chilling level of cruel, nonchalant ruthlessness that it was hard to tell which side of the conflict was the criminal, and which side was the victim. Saint had extensive martial training, but she had never witnessed such startling brutality.\n\nDetective Sunless was not a brute, though. She had enough skill to recognize just how impressive his technique and combat intelligence were. Every movement was precise and purposeful, every step was taken with calculated intent.\n\nHe tore through the heavy streams of rain with fierce momentum, always a step ahead of his opponents. It was almost as if he was controlling the two assailants like marionettes, dictating their every move — his own attacks, meanwhile, were vicious and devastating, but also elegant in their economic efficiency. There was a cadence to it all, a strange melody…\n\nAlmost like a dance.\n\n'I was… meaning to call the police…'\n\nSaint had forgotten what she was meant to do.\n\nA pained wail drowned out the rustling of the rain.\n\nThere was a revolting squelch of tearing flesh, and the crack of breaking bone. One of the assailants reeled back, his arm mangled terribly and bent at an unnatural angle. Before the second one could react, his own knife plunged between his ribs, and then a crushing blow landed on his face. As he fell to his knees with a groan, a vicious kick landed on his head.\n\nDetective Sunless leaned down and picked up the telescopic baton that had fallen to the ground. When the assailant with the broken arm turned around to flee, he brandished it with startling speed, striking the man on the temple — the bandit fell like a toppled tree and remained laying on the asphalt, motionless.\n\n\"Argh… you… bastard… I'll kill you…\"\n\nThe one with the knife in his chest grabbed the hilt with a shaking hand, straining to pull it out.\n\nThe detective looked at him and said evenly, in a matter-of-fact tone:\n\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you. That knife is the only thing keeping you alive.\"\n\nBut the assailant did not listen. He pulled the knife out, letting out a torrent of blood, then gripped it tightly and staggered to his feet.\n\nAs he took an unsteady step forward, Detective Sunless took an unhurried step back.\n\nOne, two, three, four…\n\nBy the fourth step, he was suddenly side by side with Saint.\n\nShe observed the harrowing scene with an strange indifference, as if seeing several men die in a violent confrontation was not worthy of riling up her emotions. The detective's presence was oddlу soothing.\n\nThis reaction… was definitely not normal.\n\n'I am probably in shock.'\n\nThe assailant pursued Detective Sunless with slow, swaying steps. Blood was flowing down his body, mixing with the rainwater on the ground.\n\nOne, two, three…\n\nOn the fourth step, his legs buckled, and he fell down. The knife rattled as it fell from his grip.\n\nHe did not move after that.\n\n\"You… killed them.\"\n\nSaint's voice was calm. She was calm.\n\nWhy was she so calm?\n\nDetective Sunless looked at her, remained silent for a moment, and smiled.\n\n\"Why, yes. I promised to, after all. Haven't I told you? I'm the most honest person in the world.\"\n\n'Three worlds, even.'\n\nThat was what he had said.\n\n'Extreme case of delusion of grandeur, no doubt.'\n\nDetective Sunless studied her for a few moments, then frowned.\n\n\"You're thinking something strange, aren't you? Why didn't you answer my calls?\"\n\n'Is that what's important right now?'\n\nSaint took a deep breath.\n\nThen, she answered evenly:\n\n\"I was off the clock. My sleep schedule is very important... so, I don't take calls from patients outside the designated hours.\""

    "content": "2492 Dark and Handsome\n\nSaint tried to come to terms with the situation.\n\nShe had been attacked by three strange men… they did not seem to have attacked her by chance, and they had not been trying to rob her either. They had come to kill her.\n\nThese men were dead now. One of her former patients — a detective from the Homicide Division of the Mirage City Police Department — had killed them with his bare hands, right in front of her eyes.\n\n…Well, he had killed two of them with his bare hands. The third one, he had killed with his car.\n\nAnd now, here she was.\n\nToo calm to describe her current state as a normal reaction, probably in shock.\n\n'They knew who I was. The detective seemed to have known that I would be attacked, as well. He arrived just in time.'\n\nLooking away from the corpses, Saint brushed the wet strands of her hair away from her face and looked at Detective Sunless with a slight frown. Now that everything was over, she could finally feel the bruises on her face and the cuts on her fingers.\n\nThe pain was sobering.\n\n\"How did you know that I would be in danger, Detective?\"\n\nHe stared at her for a moment, then let out a barely audible groan.\n\n\"Saint, you… you ask a lot of uncomfortable questions when you talk, don't you?\"\n\nShe did not deign to answer, looking at him impassively.\n\nDetective Sunless shook his head, and then…\n\nSuddenly took her hand.\n\nThe unexpected touch made Saint flinch.\n\n\"You're bleeding.\"\n\nThere was a dark expression on his face, and a dangerous undertone in his voice.\n\nTaking out a handkerchief from his pocket, Detective Sunless carefully wrapped it around her cut fingers and spoke:\n\n\"To answer your question. Well, you see… I knew that you would be in danger because I had met Mordret — not the CEO of the Valor Group, but his evil twin, who is an insidious bastard of epic proportions, as well as a demented mass murderer who dabbles in genocide from time to time on top of that. He and I have never really seen eye to eye, which is entirely his fault, of course. The first time we met, I ended up locked in a cage because he wanted me for my body. And it only got worse from there… wait, no, that did not come out right!\"\n\nSaint pulled her hand away. Faced with her indifferent expression, Detective Sunless coughed.\n\n\"It didn't, I'm telling you! What I meant to say was that he wanted to possess my body like a ghost, that creep. Needless to say, I was not too keen on the idea. Who would have been? Anyway, he hates me too — for no good reason whatsoever, I might add. All I did was kill his dad… what's the big deal?\"\n\nNoticing a slight shift in Saint's expression, the detective added hurriedly:\n\n\"Don't get it wrong, though! It's not what you think. He only hates me because I managed to kill his dad before he could kill that insane bastard himself. Let me tell you, that whole family is unwell… was unwell? In any case, they are all crazy… unlike us normal people...\"\n\nHearing that, Saint tilted her head a little.\n\nShe regretted not having her notebook at hand.\n\n'Projected patricide fantasies. Oedipus complex?'\n\nHe was such a fascinating case...\n\nDetective Sunless sighed.\n\n\"In any case, I met that Mordret here in Mirage City — which is a grand illusion created by an ancient demon, as I mentioned before. He informed me that there is a problem with the… the control system of this entire place, so to speak, and as a result, every real person in Mirage City is in danger. Because Mirage City… is a serial killer.\"\n\nSaint raised an eyebrow.\n\nDetective Sunless remained silent for a moment, then shrugged.\n\n\"It is. There are very few real people in this creepy city, and we are on its victim list: me, you, both versions of Mordret, my partner Effie… oh, and Morgan, as well.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"That is how I knew that you would be in danger.\"\n\nThen, his expression changed subtly, and he looked in the direction of the mental hospital.\n\n\"Oh, right. Morgan!\"\n\nSaint frowned, wondering if Detective Sunless was genuinely crazy or simply continuing his act from their last meeting.\n\n\"What about Miss Morgan?\"\n\nHe glanced at her with a somber expression.\n\n\"You might not believe me… but facts are facts. In the last two days, someone tried to kill everyone I mentioned. The CEO of the Valor Group barely survived an assassination attempt, I was nearly stabbed to death by a hired killer, you were assaulted by these three thugs, and my partner had to wipe the floor with a home invader. That… only leaves Morgan.\"\n\nHis eyes darkened.\n\n\"Who is pumped full of drugs and wearing a straitjacket.\"\n\nSaint's frown deepened. Miss Morgan wаs indeed in no condition to defend herself. But…\n\n\"The security measures of our hospital are stellar. It is practically a fortress — there's barely a safer place in the city, so I can assure you, she is perfectly fine. I saw her just half an hour ago.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"There are no fortresses that can't be breached, doc. Nowhere is safe, and nobody is safe either. For a thoroughly guarded place like your workplace… the easiest way to harm someone being kept there would probably be from within. Have there been many new faces around lately? People whom you don't know too well, or whose behavior changed all of a sudden?\"\n\nSaint opened her mouth to rebuke him, but didn't find the words to do so.\n\nThere had indeed been many new faces around as of late. People she knew had indeed been acting a bit strangely.\n\nDetective Sunless grimaced.\n\n\"Curses!\"\n\nHe fell silent for a moment, then said in an urgent tone:\n\n\"We need to go.\"\n\nBefore Saint could protest, he grabbed her by the arm and pulled her in the direction of the hospital. She had no choice but to follow him, still reeling from everything that had happened.\n\nThe detective's hold was firm and strangely reassuring.\n\n'Let's just… see what happens.'\n\nHer willingness to play along with his deranged charade was not a healthy reaction… but somehow, Saint found herself reluctant to resist, and lacking the desire to pull her arm out of his grasp.\n\n'That's because I'm in shock. Definitely.'\n\nThey waded through the rain, hurrying toward the hospital. The entrance was just like Saint had left it — it was as if three men had not tried to kill her just a few hundred metres away from the brightly illuminated premises of the hospital.\n\nThe volunteer workers were still building a barricade out of sandbags around the building. The security guards welcomed her as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Dr. Saint. Have you forgotten something?\"\n\nThey stared down Detective Sunless with cold expressions.\n\nSaint cleared her throat.\n\n\"Ah… yes. This is one of my patients. He is in need of an urgent consultation. You can check the system — there is a pass issued under his name, still.\"\n\nThe guards studied them for a few moments, then reluctantly stepped aside.\n\nSaint and Detective Sunless hurried inside. Just as they were entering, a nurse who was leaving opened the door and held it for them politely, lowering her head in a respectful bow.\n\nThey walked inside.\n\nA moment later, however, Detective Sunless froze in place.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\nSaint halted, giving him a questioning look.\n\nHe turned around with a tense expression on his handsome face.\n\nThe air was full of a subtle scent of blood.\n\n\"Where are you going, I wonder?\"\n\nSaint frowned, confused by the question. It took her a moment to realize that the question was not directed at her.\n\nFollowing his gaze, she saw the nurse who had opened the door for them stopping halfway across the threshold.\n\nThe nurse lingered for a moment, then looked back.\n\nShe was wearing clеan blue scrubs and a standard face mask, her black hair gathered in a tidy bun.\n\n…Above the mask, two beautiful vermillion eyes were staring back at the detective with a cold, calm malice.\n\n'Her eyes are red.'\n\nThey were definitely of a vibrant, vivid scarlet shade.\n\nIt was Morgan, the Valor Group heiress."

    "title": "2493 White Walls.docx",
    "content": "2493 White Walls\n\nNot long before that, Morgan heard the door lock after the psychiatrist left the room.\n\nSome time later, the door opened again, and a nurse walked in, accompanied by three burly orderlies.\n\nMorgan did not move, continuing to look out the window. She was seated in a wheelchair, her arms bound by a straitjacket… which wasn't that uncomfortable. What really drove her mad was that she was not allowed to shower without supervision, and the hospital staff was too afraid of her to wash her properly. Not that she would allow anyone to touch her.\n\nHer personal hygiene situation was sorrowful.\n\nOutside the window, the world was dark and veiled by rain. Distant spotlights were shining through the torrents of falling water on the dam that towered above the city like a great barrier. The sight of this illusory world... was strange and wondrous.\n\nMorgan was not taking in the darkly stunning landscape, though. She was tracking the movements of the four people who had entered her room in the reflections on the surface of the window.\n\nThe orderlies locked the door and took positions around her, while the nurse brightened the lights and went about preparing an injection. She filled a disposable syringe with a transparent liquid from a medical ampule, then flicked it a few times and pressed the plunger lightly to let out the tiny bubbles of air.\n\n\"Miss Morgan, I will administer your medicine now.\"\n\nHer tone was pleasant and polite.\n\nMorgan did not turn her way, continuing to face the window.\n\nShe did speak, however.\n\n\"How strange.\"\n\nThe nurse gave her a confused look. Most of her face was obscured by a mask, but there was definitely a silent question in her eyes.\n\n\"Strange? What do you mean?\"\n\nMorgan sighed.\n\n\"You are not afraid of me.\"\n\nShe finally turned her head, looking at the nurse calmly.\n\n\"Anyone on the hospital staff would be at least a little wary. You must be new. Come to think of it, I don't recognize any of you.\"\n\nThe nurse chuckled in a friendly manner.\n\n\"Oh, yes. There are a lot of recent hires in the hospital these days, Miss Morgan. Now, if you allow me…\"\n\nMorgan smiled faintly.\n\n\"Oh, but you see, not only do I not recognize you, but I am also not scheduled to receive any injections at this time. And on top of that…\"\n\nShe looked at the syringe the nurse was holding in her hand.\n\n\"The medication I've been receiving has a yellow tint. This one is entirely transparent, though. So, a nurse I don't recognize wants to inject me with a substance I don't know… at the wrong hour, no less. How peculiar, don't you think?\"\n\nThe nurse remained silent for a while, looking at her kindly.\n\nThen, kindness slowly drained from her eyes.\n\nGiving one of the orderlies a cold stare, she said in a harsh tone:\n\n\"Hold her tightly. Ah, but make sure not to leave any bruises — it has to look natural, you know.\"\n\n'Amusing.'\n\nThe orderlies stepped forward to hold Morgan down. Their rоugh hands landed on her neck and her shoulders, pressing her into the wheelchair and making it impossible for her to move. The nurse took a step in their direction, preparing the syringe.\n\nMorgan laughed.\n\n\"Four entire people to handle one poor me. Well… I guess I'm worth it. I am Morgan of Valor, after all. Even if Valor doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\nHer laughter stopped abruptly, and she pierced the nurse with a gaze so cold that it made the woman stumble.\n\n\"You made a mistake, though. Do you know what your mistake is?\"\n\nMorgan's hands moved under the white fabric of the straitjacket, as if she was turning her wrists.\n\nA derisive smile twisted her scarlet lips.\n\n\"Thinking that just four will be enough.\"\n\nThe nurse had regained her composure by then. Her eyes narrowed, and her voice gained a mocking undertone:\n\n\"Don't mind her. What can she even…\"\n\nThen, there was the sound of tearing fabric, and Morgan's ten fingers easily pierced the straitjacket. She pulled her hands down, and the tough fabric parted easily, as if cut by ten razor-sharp knives.\n\n\"I suggest you run.\"\n\nBut, of course, the three muscular orderlies holding her down and the nurse carrying a syringe full of an unidentified substance did not listen to her advice.\n\nThe patient room had padded walls. It was quite soundproof when it needed to be.\n\n…When the screams died out, Morgan exhaled slowly and looked up, at the white ceiling of the sterile room that had served as her prison cell for the past few months.\n\nThe ceiling was painted red with chaotic splatters now. The soft padding on the floor was slowly absorbing vast puddles of blood. The walls were torn apart and dripping crimson.\n\nThere was barely any white left in the room.\n\nPulling off the pitiful remains of her straitjacket, Morgan turned to the only corner that remained free of the blood. There, the supposed nurse was pressing herself against the soft walls, shivering as she looked up at Morgan with horror.\n\n\"M—monster! Monster! You are... \"\n\nDropping the torn straitjacket to the floor, Morgan walked over to the shaking woman and crouched near her.\n\n\"Hey, you.\"\n\nShe picked up the abandoned syringe from the floor and looked at the nurse impassively.\n\n\"Do you know why I left you for last?\"\n\nThe woman tried to press herself even deeper into the wall, shaking her head in terror.\n\nMorgan smiled.\n\n\"It's because I wanted to… keep your uniform clean…\"\n\nSome time later, the lights in the patient room went out. The door opened, and a woman in blue scrubs walked out into the corridor. Her face was coveгed by a mask, and her black hair was gathered in a tidy bun. She looked perfectly unassuming, just like any other nurse in the private wing of the psychiatric hospital.\n\nThe door locked behind her with an audible click.\n\nAs the woman headed away with confident steps, а passing doctor gave her a stare, and then asked in a confused tone:\n\n\"Huh? Did you just walk out of that room?\"\n\nThe woman lowered her eyes and responded politely.\n\n\"Yes. Please keep your voice down, doctor — Miss Morgan is asleep.\"\n\nHe studied her silently for a few moments…\n\nThen chuckled.\n\n\"You went there alone? Brave girl!\"\n\nShaking his head and chuckling, the doctor walked away, leaving the woman alone.\n\nShe did not linger, either, and soon, no one was left in front of the locked door and its dark window."

    "content": "2494 Escaped Lunatic\n\nMorgan made her way through the hospital without being discovered by anyone. Nobody paid her much attention — when they did, she greeted them in a polite tone and calmly walked past, pretending to be busy running an errand. At some point, though, she had to spend five minutes chatting with an especially outgoing staff member.\n\nThe man did not suspect anything and left the conversation with a pleasant impression of the polite newbie, having given the rookie several pieces of priceless advice.\n\nMorgan used the ID card of the woman she had killed in her patient room to unlock the door to the common area of the hospital, nodded at the security guard stationed there while hiding the blood-stained ID card in her pocket, and headed for the lobby.\n\nA few minutes later, she opened the door and felt the rustling of the rain envelop her.\n\nThe smell of fresh air was sweet.\n\nBefore she could step outside, however, she saw someone familiar right in front of her.\n\nIt was the Lord of Shadows, in all his rugged glory, dragging her astonishingly beautiful psychiatrist behind him.\n\nThe taciturn woman had a bloodied handkerchief wrapped around her hand.\n\nNot showing any reaction, Morgan bowed politely and held the door for them. Her heartbeat stayed steady as the pair walked past her — once they entered the lobby, she took a step forward.\n\nBut then…\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\n'Damn it.'\n\nMorgan lingered for a moment, then turned around and looked at the Lord of Shadows coldly.\n\n\"Where are you going, I wonder?\"\n\nShe studied him silently, evaluating the situation.\n\nUsually, she would have stood no chance against a Sovereign…\n\nBut they were all equal here, in Mirage City.\n\nSome were more equal than others were, though. For all intents and purposes, everyone here seemed to be perfectly mundane — with one important exception.\n\nTheir Flaws were still binding them like chains.\n\nIn the case of Morgan, her Flaw made it so that everything she touched was cut. That cruel curse had cast a lonesome shadow over most of her adult life, but here in Mirage City, it was suddenly an advantage.\n\nMorgan was pretty sure that he could kill the Lord of Shadows and his stunning companion, if it came to that.\n\nShe remained silent for a moment, and then smiled darkly beneath the mask.\n\n\"How's my little sister doing? You're treating her right?\"\n\nHe looked at her with an unhappy expression.\n\n\"Would you quit calling her your sister? It's weird. And for the record — yes, she's doing great. I try. \"\n\nMorgan felt the deep grоoves forming on the handle of the door under her fingers.\n\n'So, he did find Athena, after all.'\n\n***\n\n\"And for the record — yes, she's doing great. I try.\"\n\nSaint stared at Detective Sunless, who in turn stared at the nurse… at Morgan, the heiress of the Valor Group, who was somehow out of the patient ward and free of her straitjacket.\n\nStrangely enough, she did not seem particularly violent or unhinged, Sharp and dangerous, maybe… but perfectly in control of her thoughts and actions.\n\nHer eyes were also of an impossible scarlet colour now, apparently.\n\nAnd… her sister was dating Detective Sunless?\n\nSaint would have been pleased for her patient and happy that he was building positive relationships, if not for the fact that it was impossible. Not only because there was only one daughter in the Valor family, but also because he had been full of loathing and fixated on persecuting Morgan's brother as the culprit in the Nihilist killings for many months.\n\n'What are they talking about?'\n\nSaint was utterly confused.\n\nMorgan, meanwhile, let go of the door and took a step back.\n\n\"See you later, then. Oh, by the way... can I borrow an umbrella?\"\n\nDetective Sunless threw a sideways glance at the security guards. His gaze seemed tense, for some reason.\n\nSaint realized then that it was eerily quiet in the lobby of the hospital. Everyone — the guards, the staff members, the volunteers fortifying the building against potential floods — had grown motionless at some point, аnd were all staring at them with strangely emotionless, glassy eyes.\n\nShe could not help but shiver.\n\nDetective Sunless smiled crookedly.\n\n\"You can. But I'll do you one better… I have a PTV. Want a ride?\"\n\n'Why is he offering an escaping mental patient a ride?'\n\nMorgan hesitated for a few moments, then shrugged.\n\n\"Sure, why not. Lead the way.\"\n\nSaint opened her eyes wide.\n\n'Why is she agreeing?'\n\nStill confused, she found herself following Detective Sunless and Morgan of the Valor family through the rain. Their steps were hurried, and they were looking around with wary gazes.\n\nTheir wariness transferred to Saint, as well.\n\nIt was hard to see because of the rain, and the parking lot was desolate and empty. Any number of people could be hiding in the darkness, so reaching the detective's car… his car…\n\nSaint frowned.\n\n'The corpses!'\n\nThe corpses of the three assailants were still on the road, and when Morgan saw them, her reaction was bound to be extreme. A fragile person like her could not be exposed to such traumatic stimuli.\n\nBut before Saint could do anything, they reached the car.\n\nThe corpses were still sprawled on the road, being battered by rain. The rain washed away the blood, but it was impossible to mistake the ghastly nature of the three dark shapes laying on the asphalt for anything but what they were.\n\n'Oh, no.'\n\nSaint looked at Morgan, concerned.\n\nMorgan, meanwhile, looked at the corpses with complete indifference.\n\nA moment later, though, she smiled.\n\n\"Three… were these guys after the psychiatrist?\"\n\nDetective Sunless nodded, making Morgan's smile widen a little.\n\nShe gave the ghastly corpses another nonchalant glance.\n\n\"They sent four after me.\"\n\nThen, she looked at the detective and asked curiously:\n\n\"What about you?\"\n\nHe lingered with the answer for a while.\n\n\"A seasoned, elite assassin. Not rabble like these fools were.\"\n\nMorgan studied him silently for a moment.\n\n\"So… one.\"\n\nDetective Sunless scowled fiercely.\n\n\"He was the real deal, okay?!\"\n\nMumbling something under his nose, he dragged the most gruesome corpse to the wayside, then walked back to the car and opened the door.\n\n\"Now, are you getting in or what?\"\n\nShrugging, Morgan took off her facemask and climbed onto the backseat.\n\n'I probably should not get into that car.\"\n\nSaint hesitated for a few moments…\n\nAnd then got into the car.\n\n'Damn it.'"

It started, at least, and sped away into the rain without problem.\n\nLeaving the three corpses behind.\n\nSunny was driving, Saint was sitting stiffly in the passenger seat, while Morgan stretched on the backseat.\n\nShe looked around and grimaced.\n\n\"This… is your PTV?\"\n\nSunny looked at her through the rearview mirror.\n\n\"Sure. It trembles and roars like a dying abomination, but gets the job done. Actually…\"\n\nHe smiled smugly.\n\n\"It uses flammable fuel and propels itself with a series of tiny explosions. Wild!

It is one of the most important milestones in the history of technological development. Who wouldn't know that?\"\n\nSunny's smile dimmed.\n\n\"You are no fun. Not everyone has time to study the history of technological development, damn it.\"\n\nAt that moment, Saint, who had remained silent that whole time, finally spoke:\n\n\"Excuse me… but is it okay to just leave three dead bodies behind?\"\n\nSunny gave her a brief glance.\n\n\"Seven.\"\n\nSaint arched her exquisite eyebrow, a silent question in her eyes.\n\nHe shrugged.\n\n\"Didn't you hear Morgan saying that someone sent four people to deal with her? So, there are seven corpses, not three. She wouldn't have let them live.\"\n\nSprawled comfortably on the backseat, Morgan nodded nonchalantly.\n\nSunny gave Saint a reassuring smile.\n\n\"Don't worry, though. The rain will wash away all the traces. It might even wash away the bodies. Those in the hospital will stay where they are, of course, but that is not a problem either. Valor Group will never allow the news that their heiress massacred four people and escaped a mental asylum to spread — they won't let the news that Morgan even was in a mental asylum spread. So, the investigation will be handled.\"\n\nHe did not add that the mental asylum in question was a shady place in and of itself. Considering how affluent the families of its patients were, what happened within its walls stayed within its walls, most likely.\n\nHe was sure that many horror stories no one ever learned about had taken place in the private wing of Saint's workplace.\n\nWell… maybe not.\n\nOther Mordret's fantasy was that of a nice and friendly place where his family loved him and prospered, after all. Why would he have imagined a dirty, rotten city where dark and ugly things happened in the shadows? Then again, Sunny did not know a lot about the other Mordret. If the original Prince of Nothing had been split in two, it would have happened when he was twelve. Before that, he had been given away by his father and raised by Asterion in the Dream Realm. Who knew what his childhood had looked like, and what his idea of a nice place was?\n\nBut if Mordret's good twin had not imagined Miгage City as a dark city full of injustice and corruption… the question was, who had made this place into a twisted garden of sin? Whose thoughts had the Castellan faithfully woven into the fabric of the Palace of Imagination to change it into a den of horrors?\n\nIt could have been the real Mordret. That guy's head was full of nothing but vile and ghastly things, gods knew…\n\nWhat was it that he had told Sunny once?\n\nA mirror could only reflect what was in front of it. Was it his fault that the things in front of him were cruel, vile, and deceitful?\n\nBut it could have been someone other than Mordret, as well.\n\nIt could have been Morgan… or Effie. It could have even been Sunny himself.\n\nAll three of them had come from a world where nightmares were real. All three had spent most of their adult lives spilling blood and crawling through the bloody mud of numerous battlefields. They had killed numerous living beings — monsters and humans alike — and experienced far too many terrible things not to be changed by these experiences.\n\nMaybe Mirage City had become the dark, dirty, deadly place it was today because none of them could imagine a world that was anything but.\n\nSunny groaned slightly.\n\nIt was not because of this brief moment of self-reflection… rather, it was because the wound he had hurriedly patched up before rushing to find Saint opened sometime during the recent fight, and was seeping with blood.\n\nSaint lowered her gaze and noticed the blood stain slоwly spreading across the black fabric of his shirt. She frowned, a hint of unhappiness twisting the beautiful lines of her bewitching face.\n\n\"You are bleeding… why are you bleeding?\"\n\nSunny forced out a smile.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing. I was stabbed.\"\n\nHer eyes widened slightly.\n\n\"What? But… but I did not see you being hit during the confrontation with those people.\"\n\nSunny waved a hand dismissively.\n\n\"No, not by one of those amateurs. And it wasn't the professional, deadly, highly skilled assassin sent to kill me — I threw that guy out of a window.\"\n\nHe turned his head to glance at Morgan and grinned.\n\n\"I was stabbed by her brother. After I dealt with the assassin and before I dealt with the amateurs.\"\n\nMorgan grinned.\n\n\"Busy day for you, huh?\"\n\nSunny shrugged nonchalantly.\n\nSaint, meanwhile, seemed to be struggling with maintaining her aloof exterior.\n\nHer eyelashes, at least, quaked a little.\n\n\"You were stabbed… by the CEO of the Valor Group?\"\n\nSunny chuckled.\n\n\"No, not him. His evil twin from the real world.\"\n\nMorgan's relaxed gaze grew sharper all of a sudden.\n\n\"Oh… you've met him, then?\"\n\nSunny nodded.\n\n\"I did. And he stabbed me. Ah, but don't misunderstand — I wasn't the only one bleeding when we pаrted.\"\n\nSaint looked at him, then to Morgan.\n\nThen, she looked back at him and bit her lip, as if unsure whether to say something.\n\nIn the end, however, her indignation seemed to have defeated her taciturn personality.\n\n\"Excuse me… is that important right now? Miss Morgan, why are you playing along with his bizarre statements? Did you not hear what Detective Sunless said? An evil twin from the real world! Why is your reaction so lackluster?\"\n\nMorgan gave her a strange look and blinked a couple of times.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, she shrugged.\n\n\"Because everything he said is true? The man playing the CEO role in this illusory realm, my brother, has a murderous twin from the real world. Who, I guess, is also my brother.\"\n\nShe shifted her gaze to Sunny and asked in a confused tone:\n\n\"Does she not remember anything?\"\n\nThen, Morgan frowned and looked at Saint.\n\n\"And since when is the Lord of Shadows, the dark Sovereign of humanity, the commander of an undying legion of dead souls… a detective?\"\n\nSaint inhaled slowly, closed her eyes for a moment, and then turned to the window.\n\nSunny could just barely hear her mumble under her nose:\n\n\"Shared delusional disorder… it must be. Fascinating…\""

    "content": "2496 Between The Cracks\n\nWith Saint seemingly falling into a daze, Sunny threw a glance into the rearview mirror and studied Morgan for a few moments.\n\nThe Princess of Valor… looked different from how she had been before.\n\nMorgan had always given off a sharp and deadly aura, and all her actions had been calculated and precise. She had carried herself with the reserved elegance of a born noble, maintaining a neat appearance in all circumstances. She had been a person who preferred to maintain strict control of both herself and everything around her at all times.\n\nThat Morgan… would have never allowed herself to sprawl on the backseat of a ramshackle PTV in a perfectly comfortable pose, not even trying to maintain the rules of decorum.\n\nShe was still sharp and dangerous, just much more… relaxed and at ease.\n\nAs if she could not be bothered to care anymore.\n\n…Granted, Morgan Steel managed to look elegant and like she owned the place even when wearing a nurse uniform and lounging in a rusty PTV. It was just that she brimmed with a decadent kind of elegance now instead of her usual refined poise.\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n\"So, why did Mordret come here, and why did you follow him to Mirage City?\"\n\nAll the pieces to the odd puzzle of the Great Mirror were held by three people: Mordret, the other Mordret, and Morgan… the children of the late King of Swords.\n\n'King of Swords…'\n\nSunny tensed.\n\nHe was not going to receive two \"you killed my father\" speeches in one day, was he?\n\nLuckily, Morgan seemed entirely indifferent to the fact that she was sitting next to her father's killer. Hearing his question, she lingered for a few moments, then smiled.\n\n\"You got it all wrong… Sunless. It wasn't me who followed Mordret here. It was the other way around.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"You entered the Great Mirror first?\"\n\nMorgan nodded.\n\n\"Back then, after you and Nephis killed Ki Song… and my father… things were in utter chaos for the first few months, weren't they?\"\n\nSunny nodded. The first months of the newly established Human Domain had indeed been hectic. After all, it was not easy to build a new world order on the ruins of an old one… luckily, they had received a lot of help.\n\nIronically enough, the Legacy Clans had played an important part in putting the world back on track. The government had been nothing short of instrumental, as well, with Jet mobilizing the great bureaucracies of its various arms to smooth out the transition.\n\nEffie had taken control of the Sword Domain and Bastion. Kai had taken over the Song Domain and Ravenheаrt…\n\nMorgan had spent those first few months there with him, helping the charming archer build a solid foundation for his future rule.\n\nThen, she disappeared without a trace.\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\nMorgan shrugged lazily.\n\n\"While you were busy conquering the world… well, Nephis was busy conquering the world. You were busy playing dead. Congratulations on your resurrection, by the way.\"\n\nSunny smiled.\n\n\"You don't sound that surprised.\"\n\nMorgan deigned him with a scoff.\n\n\"Please. Learning that the comely Master I had knighted was the Lord of Shadows was a bit of a shock. Inferring that you did nоt really turn on Nephis or die by her sword was a piece of cake.\"\n\nSunny grimaced.\n\n\"Almost everyone else truly believes that I'm dead, you know?\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"Everyone else is not me. Anyway… while the two of you were busy putting out numerous fires and dealing with the fallout of the war, Mordret and I were busy doing something else. The King of Swords and the Queen of Worms had left certain things behind — things that very few people knew existed, and even fewer were in a position to retrieve.\"\n\nMorgan sighed.\n\n\"Mordret plundered our father's secret inheritance while hunting down the members of the extended Valor family. I tried to intercept them and extend at least some measure of protection, but… you should know that man by now. He is elusive, indestructible, and utterly deadly. And I was not in the position to protect anyone, really. I was busy trying to stay alive myself.\"\n\nShe remained silent for a few moments, then shook her head.\n\n\"So, I plundered pieces of Ki Song's inheritance instead. Her daughters got to most of it eventually, but I had the advantage of being in Ravenheart before they returned — due to being kidnapped by Nightingale.\"\n\nMorgan paused, then asked in an indifferent tone:\n\n\"How… is he doing, by the way?\"\n\nSunny smiled.\n\n\"Who, that guy? Oh, he's doing great. Better than anyone with a drop of shame would have the audacity to, really. He lives in a stunning palace, surrounded by stunning Transcendent princesses from all sides. It's like a flower garden. What's not to love?\"\n\nSomehow, Morgan did not seem particularly glad to hear that.\n\n'I guess she is still resentful of Kai because of the kidnapping.'\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\nHe knew a thing or two about spite, but some people were just too vindictive!\n\n\"So what was it that Ki Song left behind?\"\n\nMorgan remained silent for a few moments, then shrugged somberly.\n\n\"This and that. Information, among other things. For example, she left behind a piece of information I was aiming to find, to begin with. I knew that Mordret would come for me sooner or later… I also knew that Ki Song would have never accepted him into the Song Domain without investigating possible countermeasures against his betrayal first. Turns out, she managed to learn more about my brother than even our father had.\"\n\nShe smiled faintly.\n\n\"Our father tried to obliterate Mordret quite thoroughly, you know. His body was destroyed… his soul was destroyed, too. But he still refused to die, maybe because his reflections remained intact. In the end, all we could do was imprison him in a mirror trap. Well, as it turns out…\"\n\nMorgan looked out the window at the vista of the Mirage City and exhaled slowly.\n\n\"Turns out, he couldn't be killed because his death was somewhere else. My brother Mordret was split apart when he conquered the First Nightmare. Different versions of him inherited different parts of his being... and only one of them inherited his death.\"\n\nShe raised a hand and pointed at the lights of the sprawling city.\n\n\"He must have brought that version to the Great Mirror after returning to Bastion, and hid him inside.\"\n\nMorgan turned to Sunny and smiled.\n\n\"So, you see… if we kill the CEO of the Valor Group, we can finally be rid of my dear brother once and for all.\""

    "content": "2497 The Ones Who Walk Away\n\nHearing that, Saint finally looked away from the vista of the drowning city outside the window. She stared at Morgan coldly for a few moments, then turned to glance at Sunny.\n\nA faint crease appeared on her brow.\n\nEven if she did not say anything, Sunny could imagine what she was thinking…\n\n'Enough is enough. Be happily crazy together all you want, but if you start discussing plans of assassinating someone, I am calling the police!'\n\n'...Wait. He is the police.'\n\nSunny cleared his throat and focused on the road.\n\n'She is not wrong.'\n\nHe remained silent for a while, then asked in a neutral tone:\n\n\"Is that how you ended up locked in an asylum? You tried to kill the other Mordret?\"\n\nMorgan pursed her lips, then let out a sigh.\n\n\"Yes. Sadly, I failed.\"\n\nHer expression grew a little wistful.\n\n\"Ki Song might have found out about my brother's Flaw and where he had hidden it, but she did not know a lot about the Great Mirror, let alone about what is hidden on its other side. So, finding myself in Mirage City was quite a… novel experience. Suddenly becoming mundane again was a difficult transition, as well.\"\n\nMorgan looked at her hands.\n\n\"Plus, I was severely wounded while trying to sneak past the Cursed Demon you had deposited in True Bastion. Soul damage, mental damage… you name it. I was in rough shape, and Mordret — the real Mordret — was on my heels. So, I might have acted a little hasty.\"\n\nHer expression soured.\n\n\"Killing the most powerful man in Mirage City as a mundane person turned out to be more difficult than I expected. He is protected incredibly well, with an army of bodyguards following him day and night — both in plain view and hidden. Well, anyway, he survived. I thought I'd be disposed of right there and then, but he must have grown attached to my false self… he looked quite distressed, even.\"\n\nMorgan scoffed.\n\n\"You'll find it hard to believe, but I did not end up in that mental hospital because he wanted to get rid of me quietly. There were no nefarious reasons behind his decision to commit me to a psychiatric facility whatsoever — rather, he seemed to harbor genuine hope that I would be fixed and return to how my counterpart was before.\"\n\nShe shoоk her head.\n\n\"That guy… something is not right with him. He is not quite as twisted as the real one, but he is definitely not entirely there.\"\n\nSunny smiled crookedly.\n\n\"You do remember that you just escaped from a mental hospital? Should you really be going around calling people insane?\"\n\nMorgan chuckled.\n\n\"Fair. \"\n\nSunny lingered for a few moments.\n\n\"You seem to have escaped quite easily, though. I suspect that you could have left that place whenever you wanted. So why did you stay?\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"Because for a while, it was the safest place for me to be. The other Mordret might have spared me, but the real one was still out there, determined to finish what he had started during the Battle of the Black Skull. I was laying low and gathering information about Mirage City… until my fortress suddenly wasn't that safe anymore. It was time to leave.\"\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"Wait, but how did you regain your sense of self, to begin with? There was no Effie around to make you remember. Was it because you were the ruler of Bastion, at some point?\"\n\nMorgan smiled, then shook her head.\n\n\"No… it was because I killed my reflection a long time ago.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe chuckled.\n\n\"Long before my Awakening, my father brought me in front of the Great Mirror — its false version in the illusory Bastion — and made me fight my reflection, until one of us was destroyed. That is why this place has a weaker hold on me than it had on you. I suspect that my brother is the same.\"\n\n'Huh.'\n\nSunny smiled darkly.\n\n'And I thought I couldn't despise Anvil any more.'\n\nHe lingered for a while, then shook his head.\n\n\"Anyway, we can't kill the other Mordret. At least not yet.\"\n\nMorgan pierced him with a sharp look.\n\n\"And why is that?\"\n\nHe hesitated for a while, trying to put his thoughts into words.\n\nEventually, Sunny said:\n\n\"Well, first of all… he has been living here for the past two decades. And from the looks of it — and believe me, I can't quite believe I'm saying it — this version of Mordret seems like a nice guy. He's an innocent bystander, so what right do we have to kill him?\"\n\nMorgan laughed.\n\n\"Wait, what is this? Are you really giving me the 'world is not worth saving if the price of saving it is a tear of an innocent child' speech? Hey. This is Mirage City, not Omelas, and you are the Lord of Shadows, not Ivan Karamazov. It's a nice sentiment… how very noble of you, wanting to spare him. I'm in awe. But will you take responsibility when the next House of Night massacre happens?\"\n\nSunny frowned.\n\n\"Oh, please... don't pretend like you care about what happened to the House of Night — gods know your own hands are not exactly clean either. You've committed your own share of despicable deeds, Princess of Valor.\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"But I see your point. Not that I know what Omelettes and… I can't even pronounce the sеcond one… you're talking about, mind you. No need to swing your Legacy education around, okay? In any case, why would I take responsibility for something your crazy brother does?\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n\"Anyway, that is not the real reason why we can't kill the other Mordret. He has to stay alive because he is the axis of Mirage City. This whole place has been created by the Castellan — the chief reflection who serves as the custodian of the Great Mirror — to suit his fantasies. Even if there are foreign influences twisting the fabric of Mirage City now, its foundation is still what your other brother has imagined.\"\n\nHe looked at the city lights flying past the window of the PTV and grimaced.\n\n\"Do you see the problem here? Whose imagination will become the foundation of this illusory realm if the other Mordret is removed? Will it be you, me? Do you even know what kind of horrors dwell in our imagination, Morgan? I don't know about you, but I've seen things so dreadful that merely witnessing them will instantly shatter the minds and extinguish the souls of mundane people. And I have quite an active imagination on top of that.\"\n\nSunny let out a joyless laugh.\n\n\"Imagination seems like a whimsical power — a sweet and fanciful power that makes dreams and fantasies come true. But when you think about it, it is perhaps the most harrowing thing in existence. Because one can imagine horrors, too… and unlike reality, imagination has no limits.\"\n\nMirage, the Demon of Imagination, had always seemed obscure when compared to her more prominent siblings, so Sunny never really considered her that deeply. He did not know a lot about her, either.\n\nBut now that he was inside her abandoned palace, he was starting to suspect that she had been no less sinister and frightening — perhaps much more so — than the rest of the daemons.\n\nNo wonder the moon itself had to be shattered just to bring down her castle.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"The point is, we do not even know how to escape the Great Mirror. Effie does not have full control of the Palace of Imagination because the damn Castellan has gone rampant and usurped the role of the Castle Master. So, until we find the Castellan and deal with it, the other Mordret has to stay alive.\"\n\nSunny looked at the rearview mirror, looking into Morgan's glowing vermilion eyes.\n\n\"We'll decide what to do with him then. Understоod?\"\n\nMorgan remained silent for a while, then scoffed.\n\n\"Well, if you put it like that…\"\n\nShe paused and shivered visibly.\n\n\"Yeah. Let's keep him alive, for now. We… we can't risk letting Athena's imagination run wild in this place. That simply cannot happen, no matter what…\""

    "title": "2498 Detective Story.docx",
    "content": "2498 Detective Story\n\n\"Where are we going, anyway?\"\n\nMorgan looked out of the window at the blurry outlines of the old buildings, with plumes of foaming water escaping from the rusty drainpipe spouts. The gutters were drowning and gargling, unable to swallow the rainwater fast enough — this part of the city was one of the poorer ones, with many houses standing empty and abandoned, condemned for renovation.\n\nSunny remained silent for a moment, then responded in a neutral tone:\n\n\"Somewhere we can regroup and plan what to do next without worrying about being killed by random passersby.\"\n\nBy now, he was starting to understand how the Palace of Imagination operated. It was designed to bring fantasies to life — fantasies that belonged to the Castle Master, to be precise. However, the wondrous mechanisms of this impossible place were broken and in a state of disrepair, having surrendered to the ruthless burden of time in the absence of their creator.\n\nThe Castellan was one such faulty mechanism. It was more of a function than a being, and that function had gone rogue. It had usurped the authorities of the Castle Master — not for a selfish or nefarious puгpose, but simply in an attempt to keep faithfully performing its duty. To make the imagination of those who visited the Great Mirror a reality.\n\nThe Castellan was failing, though.\n\nThings must have been stable when the only human residing in the Palace of Imagination was the other Mordret. The Castellan had created Mirage City and took care of that abandoned human child… the only real person in the city of reflections. That was why Mordret had been able to survive and grow up into a semblance of a sane man.\n\nHowever, now there were more humans in the Palace of Imagination, and all their complicated human wishes and emotions were clashing against each other.\n\nThe Castellan was slowly coming undone under the contradictory input it was receiving from the uninvited guests, and Mirage City was coming undone with it.\n\nSo… like any living being, Mirage City was trying to protect itself.\n\nThat was why every real person within its bounds had faced life-threatening situations as of late. At first, it was just Mordret, who had been hunted by the Nihilist — a serial killer who did not really exist, and was instead a collective manifestation of the city's lethal will.\n\nBut now that Sunny, Effie, and Saint were added into the mix, the ways in which Mirage City was trying to deal with them were becoming more sophisticated. Sunny noted it while fighting the thugs who had accosted Saint. They weren't random people whom the Castellan had taken control of and sent to kill her — otherwise, they would not have come prepared and armed with the tools of their dirty trade. They would not have known her name and her background… they would not have been able to talk at all.\n\nInstead, they would have been no different from the glassy-eyed zombies whom the inhabitants of Mirage City seemed to turn into when someone nearby was acting out of character.\n\nThe same could be said about the four hired killers who had infiltrated the mental asylum and come to kill Morgan, disguised as staff members. And Sunny had a feeling that the assassin who had broken into his apartment was the same.\n\nAnd that… that was enough for him to make conclusions about the way Mirage City was trying to get rid of them.\n\nIt was just as the real Mordret had said. Unlike reality, the Palace of Imagination was a place capable of being changed not only proactively, but also retroactively. There had not been a Nihilist before, but now that Sunny and Effie were walking the streets of Mirage City, there was. There always had been, even — the past was changed to fit the present.\n\nAnd judging by what happened tonight, it had not been changed randomly.\n\n'The Castellan is building a… story.'\n\nThe Castellan was struggling to keep the grand illusion intact, so it tried to remove the foreign irritants in a way that compromised the integrity of Mirage City the least. In other words, whoever wanted to kill Sunny, Saint, Effie, Morgan, and Mordret had to have the means, motive, and opportunity that fit the internal logic of Mirage City.\n\nEven if this mysterious culprit had not existed yesterday, they did today — they had existed today.\n\nWhich meant that the mystery could be solved. The culprit could be found and neutralized…\n\nWith some good old-fashioned detective work.\n\nSunny smiled darkly.\n\n\"First, we need to ensure our safety. Then, we need to find our adversary and crush them. And then…\"\n\nHe lingered for a few moments.\n\nThat was where true difficulty lay. The culprit, whoever they were, was merely a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself. Finding and dealing with them would buy Sunny and his companions time, but it would not solve the fundamental issue.\n\nWhom they really needed to find was the Castellan.\n\nA single reflection in a city of twenty million Others.\n\nHow the hell were they supposed to discover it?\n\nSunny sighed. \"Then, we will think of something.\"\n\nThe PTV stopped near one of the abandoned buildings. This one was larger and more imposing than the rest of the houses surrounding it, albeit just as forlorn and decrepit.\n\nIt was an old church.\n\nLooking at it through the windshield, Sunny sighed.\n\n\"What is it with me and ruined cathedrals…\"\n\nIt seemed that he was a magnet for dilapidated temples, just like Kai was a magnet for dragons.\n\nImmediately after dealing with the assassin and clashing with Mordret, Sunny had contacted Effie to warn her about a possible attack. They briefly discussed a few things, including the need to find a shelter — this church was the location they chose.\n\nThis entire neighborhood was scheduled for renovation, so it was mostly cleared out in preparation for the initial round of demolition. However, the director of the company contracted by the city to perform the costly project… ended up becoming one of the Nihilist's victims.\n\nThe works stalled, and the empty neighborhood ended up in a state of limbo. Very few people still resided here, and even fewer visited, since this area was out of the way of everything. So, it was a perfect spot for a hideout.\n\n\"Let's go. We'll be… we should be safe here.\"\n\nHe opened the door and climbed out of the PTV first. Saint and Morgan followed.\n\nJust then, bright headlights ignited in the darkness, illuminating the falling torrents of rain and nearly blinding them.\n\nAnother PTV was parked in the shadow of the decrepit church, all but invisible in the rain. Its door opened, and a tall figure stepped out into the light.\n\nA black umbrella opened with a quiet sound.\n\n…Holding the umbrella with one hand and a half-eaten donut with the other, Effie gave Sunny and his companions a placid look.\n\nThen, she grinned.\n\n\"Hey, Morgan. Hey…\"\n\nHer gaze landed on Saint, and her eyes widened.\n\n\"You... w—who the hell are you?\"\n\nSunny sighed.\n\n\"This is Saint. My Shadow.\"\n\nEffie stared at him with a stunned expression.\n\n\"You mean that this… this is the fearsome onyx knight that always follows you around? This gorgeous creature?!\"\n\nSunny scratched the back of his head.\n\n\"Yes? Oh, right… you never saw her without a helmet. I forgot.\"\n\nEffie opened her mouth, then closed it, then opened it again.\n\n\"Does Nephis know?!\"\n\nHe raised an eyebrow, confused.\n\n\"Know what?\"\n\nEffie stared at him for a few more moments, then closed her eyes and shook her head.\n\n\"Never mind… let's go inside, I'm freezing. \"\n\nShe could not help to steal another glance at Saint, though.\n\nWell, Sunny could not blame her. Saint had been made in the image of Storm God, after all.\n\nIt was not every day that one got to behold the face of a goddess..."

    "content": "2499 Playing With Water\n\nThe interior of the church was just as dilapidated as its exterior. The roof was not leaking, at least — that was a relief, considering that they were going to have to spend some time here.\n\nThere was surprisingly little dust, too. A wide open space led to an ornate altar, with rows of benches covered in white fabric. Above it all, tall stained-glass windows were shimmering dimly with the pale light of electric street lamps.\n\nThe dark expanse of the abandoned church was illuminated with colorful radiance because of it.\n\nSunny did not mind the forlorn ambiance and the poignant feeling of lost sanctity. He quite liked decrepit temples, actually… visiting one made him feel nostalgic.\n\nMorgan, however, seemed a little surprised.\n\nShe looked around with curiosity, then shook her head.\n\n\"This is not right.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"What is?\"\n\nShe gestured to the altar and the stained-glass windows above it.\n\n\"This church. The iconography does not match any of the religions that would have been widespread before the Dark Times. At least none that I recognize.\"\n\nSunny scratched the back of his head.\n\nHe did not really know a lot about religion — few people did, in the world of the Nightmare Spell.\n\nIt was hard to believe in anything after learning that the gods did exist, but were dead. The government had spent decades discouraging worship of any kind, as well. Perhaps it was because various cults had caused a lot of trouble for the First Generation, both the government and the Legacy Clans wanted people to seek spiritual fulfillment in things other than mystical beliefs.\n\nIt was only now that Nephis had ascended to Supremacy that worship was once again spreading among the population — in more senses than one.\n\nNephis and the Fire Keepers were dealing with people who were starting to worship the Immortal Flame and its last daughter, while Sunny and the Shadow Clan were busy dealing with the doomsday cults that kept sprouting from the ground like mushrooms after the rain.\n\nIn any case, he had only a very vague impression of what religions were being exercised during the Dark Times, let alone before them.\n\n\"What, are you an expert on ancient religions, too?\"\n\nMorgan gave him a wry smile.\n\n\"You told me not to swing my Legacy education around.\"\n\nSunny coughed.\n\n\"Oh… yes, I did.\"\n\nHe looked around.\n\n\"So what's wrong with this church?\"\n\nCome to think of it…\n\nHe frowned. It was only now that he noticed that there were tall mirrors artfully installed here and there around the church. Their masterful placement made it so that endless kaleidoscopes of reflections stretched into infinity, catching the light falling from the stained-glass windows and making the interior of the church seem many times larger than it was.\n\nIt would have looked wondrous and beautiful… if not for his memories of the Mirror Maze that made Sunny's skin crawl.\n\n'I hate mirrors.'\n\nMorgan shrugged.\n\n\"It's just… anachronistic? I'm not sure if that word really fits. The point I am trying to make is that there would not have been a church like this one on Earth, in this period of time. The outward symbology of temples and churches of Mirage City is quite consistent with historic records, though, so I find it strange.\"\n\nAt that moment, Saint, who had kept silent for the longest time, finally let her voice be heard.\n\nLooking at them in exasperation, she asked:\n\n\"What are you talking about? This is a church dedicated to Mirage. There are thousands of them around the city.\"\n\nSunny, Morgan, and Effie all looked at her in confusion.\n\nHe tilted his head a little.\n\n\"Mirage? The Demon of Imagination?\"\n\nSaint seemed similarly confused.\n\n\"Who else?\"\n\nSunny scratched the tip of his nose.\n\n'Oh… so the name of the city is not just a coincidence.'\n\nFrom what he could tell, Mirage City was a faithful reproduction of a human settlement from before the Dark Times. This church was the first obvious discrepancy they found — a foreign concept in an otherwise meticulous imitation of a mundane city on Earth.\n\nHe was suddenly very curious.\n\n\"Why would people worship a daemon, though?\"\n\nSaint remained silent for a while, then sighed.\n\n\"Who knows? I am not a religious person myself. It is an important part of our cultural heritage, though, so one should naturally be familiar with it.\"\n\nShe gave Sunny a reproachful look.\n\n\"Obviously, there is no reliable evidence to prove that Mirage actually existed, let alone that she wielded miraculous powers — let us not even mention the deeper meaning people put into the stories of her supposed deeds. However, it is easy to gather that she is at least based on a real historical figure from circumstantial data.\"\n\nSunny raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"What data?\"\n\nSaint looked at him with reproach.\n\n\"It is the existence of Mirage City itself, of course. A thriving settlement could not have been founded here without the system of dams that make its existence possible. These dams have existed in some form or fashion for thousands of years… obviously, they have been modernized and renovated countless times — the latest iteration of the northern dam was just renovated by the Valor Group, for example — but if myths are to be believed, it was Mirage who designed and built the dams first.\"\n\nShe looked around the church with a hint of reverence in her eyes.\n\n\"If so, then even if she did not possess any miraculous powers, she must have been a true genius. It is a stunning feat, to have constructed something so grand and advanced all those years ago... the dams of Mirage City are not considered one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world for nothing. Even if Mirage is a collective persona of several generations of architects and engineers, it is still impressive.\"\n\nSunny smiled faintly.\n\nIt wаs interesting how the fictional mythology of Mirage City somewhat reflected the reality of the Dream Realm. Bastion itself had been surrounded by great dams once, after all.\n\nRivergate had withstood the apocalypse and the passage of time, only to end up being destroyed by Morgan and Mordret — albeit it was already being rebuilt by the forces of humanity, including Beth and Rain. The northern dam had been obliterated eons ago, though. In fact, Sunny had only learned of its existence by chance, when Effie mentioned finding its remains in True Bastion.\n\nIts ruins in the False Bastion were gone. Maybe humans had not discovered them yet, or perhaps they had simply been obliterated when the mortal realms were devoured by the Dream Realm. In any case, there was no twin Citadel to Rivergate to be found anywhere.\n\nNeither Sunny nor Effie had known for sure that it was Mirage who had built the dams surrounding the Mirror Lake, though, just like she hаd built Bastion.\n\nMaybe \"built\" wasn't the right word — considering that he was thinking of the Demon of Imagination, she might have simply imagined them, and then made her fantasy real.\n\nIt was fascinating, though…\n\n\"But why would the Demon of Imagination be so interested in building dams?\"\n\nSaint seemed to be a little confused by the question.\n\nShe hesitated for a few moments, then shrugged.\n\n\"You will receive different answers from diffeгent people. If you follow the religious dogma, though… she built them to create mirrors.\""

    "title": "2500 Her Reflection.docx",
    "content": "2500 Her Reflection\n\nSunny blinked a few times.\n\n\"The Demon of Imagination created a system of huge dams… to produce mirrors?\"\n\nSaint shook her head.\n\n\"Not produce mirrors. To create mirrors.\"\n\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\"What is the difference?\"\n\nWhile Saint considered the answer, Sunny looked around the dark church once again, noting the infinity mirrors stretching into the endlessness all around him. The colorful radiance of the stained-glass windows was trapped in them, creating beautiful kaleidoscopes. It was indeed a whimsical and beautiful sight worthy of the Demon of Imagination… and yet, Sunny could not see how Mirage and mirrors were connected.\n\nHe knew that there was a connection, though. There had to be.\n\nAfter all, True Bastion was hidden in the reflection of the illusory Bastion, and two Great Mirrors — the real one and its reflection — were at the heart of two great castles. True Bastion was contained within the false Great Mirror, while the Palace of Imagination was contained within the true one.\n\nAnd that was where the Others came from.\n\nAs far as Sunny knew, there was no other place in the Dream Realm where one could encounter the Others. At least he had not encountered such a nightmarish region yet.\n\nSo, it was hard to argue with the fact that there was a odd bond between Mirage, mirrors, and the Others.\n\nBut what was it?\n\nFinally, Saint found the right words:\n\n\"According to myth, Mirage created mirrors. As in… she did not simply craft one, or even the first one — she crafted the very concept of reflections, and allowed the world to see itself for what it was. That is why other deities disliked and shunned her… because she showed them the most cruel sight of all. She showed them the truth of whаt they looked like, and of what they were.\"\n\nSunny blinked a couple of times.\n\nEffie was busy carrying boxes out of the trunk of her car, while Morgan was staring at her reflection with a peculiar expression on her pale face. So, he was the only one left to ask questions:\n\n\"What do you mean, crafted the concept of reflections? Thаt does not make any sense. What did the world look like before she invented mirrors, then? Were there no reflective surfaces anywhere at all?\"\n\nThat sounded quite preposterous.\n\nBut then again…\n\nThat was a daemon he was talking about. Hope had invented the concept of writing, while Nether had created a whole race of living beings.\n\n...Weaver had created the Nightmare Spell.\n\nSo who was to say that Mirage could not have invented the concept of reflections? Saint shrugged.\n\n\"This is a myth, after all. Myths do not need to follow logic or reason… at least not the kind of logic or reason we would recognize as such. It all seemed perfectly reasonable to people who invented these myths, though.\"\n\nShe looked into one of the mirrors decorating the church.\n\n\"According to myth, Mirage was sad and lonely one day. She could imagine anything in the world, but she could not imagine herself. So, she decided to make something out of nothing to do what she could not, and entertain herself.\"\n\nSaint pointed to her reflection.\n\n\"So, Mirage found a place where water flowed across the mountains and created a series of dams and complicated lock systems. That was how the Mirror Lake was born, even if it was not called that back then yet. The Mirror Lake was vast and perfectly flat. Its surface was meant to become the first mirror.\"\n\nSunny could not help but blink a few times.\n\n'Huh.'\n\nSo that was the secret of the great dams and vast artificial lakes Mirage had created?\n\nThose lakes… were simply massive mirrors of her making?\n\nThe first mirrors to ever exist.\n\nThat definitely gave the name of the Mirror Lake a new meaning.\n\n'Leave it to daemons to do everything on a completely ridiculous scale.'\n\n\"So what happened next?\"\n\nSaint looked at him evenly.\n\n\"According to one myth, she took mist from a distant mountain chain and trapped it in the water. Strange creatures dwelled in that mist, and they became trapped in the lake, too — thosе creatures were shapeless and only existed when one looked at them, but she bent them into taking the shape of whoever looked into the water, and whatever faced the water. The first thing the creatures beheld was the moon, and so, the first mirror was born when moonlight touched the surface of the lake.\"\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\"According to a different myth, she trapped nothing in the water, and imprisoned nobody in the lake. But when the moon rose above the world at night, Mirage imagined touching it, and so, nothing became something, giving birth to the first reflection. In any case, after that, the creatures created by the Demon of Imagination out of nothing spread, eventually populating all of existence. It is just that they dwell in a place between somewhere and nowhere — the Mirror Realm — and rarely come in contact with the real world.\"\n\nSunny stared at her with wide eyes.\n\n'Wait… why does that… make sense?'\n\nIf he were indeed to believe that Mirage created the very concept of reflections, then she would have needed building blocks to realize her grand design. The mist from a distant mountain chain… that had to have been pure nothingness from the Hollow Mountains.\n\nSunny had noted once that the Nothing Creatures and the Others were alike, in some regard. After all, the Nobodies only came into existence when they were perceived by someone. Similarly, reflections only took shape when one stood in front of a mirror — if there was nothing to reflect, the mirror remained empty.\n\nThe Others thrived on being witnessed, too.\n\nSo wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that the Nothing Creatures and the Others… were kin?\n\nIt was just that the former were wild and untamed, while the latter were domesticated and reshaped by the Demon of Imagination, becoming a closely related, but entirely new kind of beings.\n\nLike wolves and dogs.\n\nMirage had first created the Others in the Mirror Lake, and from there, they spread everywhere, until mirrors and reflections were commonplace throughout existence. As if an addition was made to the universal laws forming it.\n\nBuilding an entire new concept on top of the universal laws of existence. That… would indeed have been an accomplishment worthy of a daemon.\n\nSaint smiled faintly.\n\n\"Mirage beheld herself and surrounded herself with reflections. So, she wasn't sad or lonely anymore.\"\n\nSunny shivered.\n\n'The great taboo placed upon the daemons by the gods.'\n\nDaemons had been prohibited from siring offspring, and many — maybe most of them — had tried to rebel against that prohibition in one way or another. Weaver had created the Lineage, Nether had created the Stone Saints, Hope had settled among humans and nurtured them, Ariel had raised the Jade Queen…\n\nSo what had Mirage done?\n\nHad she created the Others, populated her Palace of Imagination with them, and enjoyed their companionship to lessen her solitude?\n\nIf so, then the Palace of Imagination might not have been merely a daemon's playground…\n\nIt might have been a place where her own fantasy had come true."

    "content": "2501 Hidden in Reflectiоns\n\nSunny remained silent for a while, thinking about Mirage and her whimsical kingdom. A land of towering dams, sprawling forests, lakes that glistened under the sun, and illusory castles that drifted upon the bed of reflected clouds… a place where fantasies came true.\nA playground populated by beings she had imagined to сure her solitude and entertain her. \nSunny thought about how it had ended up, as well. \nA broken sky, a shattered moon. A great castle that lay in ruins, and a drowned city hidden at the bottom of an abominable lake, with countless bones buried in the silt.\nThe only untainted things that remained of the Demon of Imagination were the illusory simulacrum on her beautiful citadel and the imaginary palace hidden in the reflections.\nThe former had been usurped by the Nightmare Spell and fashioned into a great stronghold for the Awakened, while the latter… the latter was slowly falling apart, having been left without a master for too long.\nSunny sighed.\nHe had always loved unraveling the ancient mysteries of the Dream Realm… but at some point, delving deeper into its dark past became intertwined with a sense of wistful melancholy.\nPerhaps it was because he had become so much more powerful now. The protagonists of those ancient stories were nоt as distant and unreachable as they had seemed once… the gods, the daemons. Now that Sunny was halfway to becoming a deity himself, he could not perceive them as vast, faceless forces of nature anymore.\nHe could relate to their woes and sorrows, somewhat, and therefore was unable to deny their personhood.\n'Should I really be feeling sorry for them, though?'\nThose bastards were the ones who had ruined the world, after all. They were to blame for turning all of existence into a graveyard.\nBut no matter how Sunny tried, he could not bring himself to hate the deities of bygone eras. Their fate was already tragic, and their ends were already bitter enough. It was all one big mess of cosmic proportions, and that mess was too distant and too vast for him to care about it personally.        \n\"A wonderful lecture.\"\nMorgan had approached him and Saint at some point, and chose that moment to speak.\n\"I did not know. It is strange, really, how little we knew about Bastion — my grandfather had conquered it, after all, and my father ruled it for decades. I guess it was only to be expected, though, considering how wary both of them were of the Great Mirror.They spent decades guarding against it instead of trying to unravel its mysteries… I can't help but wonder if things would have been different if they were more curious.\"\nEffie, who had brought the last box from the trunk of her PTV — or rather, her family PTV — placed it on the floor and shook off drops of water from her shoulders.\n\"Of course, things would have been different.\"\nShe looked at Morgan and smiled.\n\"Your grandfather, your daddy, and you would have been replaced by the Others decades ago. I hate to admit it, but let's give credit where credit is due… if there was one thing Anvil did right, it was keeping the Great Mirror covered at all times. As the current ruler of Bastion, that is precisely what I am doing, too.\"\nMorgan gave her a dark look, then shrugged.\n\"...Fair enough.\"\nSunny interrupted them in а neutral tone:\n\"That is great and all, but shall we get down to business? Effie…\"\nHe gestured to Saint, who seemed to have tensed as a result.\n\"Will you do the honors?\"\nIt was sort of fun to see this side of his taciturn Shadow, but Sunny needed his trusted general more than he wanted to have fun. So, they needed to make Saint remember who she was sooner rather than later.\nHaving her going around while believing that she was a human, and a psychiatrist from before the Dark Times at that, was not only of little use, but also a hindrance.\nOf course... thеre was a risk in making Saint remember, as well. Sunny did not know how she would behave after regaining her memories, but while still \ntrapped in the body of a mundane human. Becoming mundane had been quite a shock for him, after all, and Saint was not even of the same species.        \nLiving as a human would be an entirely alien experience to her. Would she still be able to play the role of Dr. Saint? If not, they would hаve an entirely different problem on their hands.\nNevertheless... there was a lot of irony in the fact that Saint would have to experience what being a human felt like not long after Sunny had experienced being a Stone Saint.\nIn any case, the benefits outweighed the risks.\nEffie stared at him for a bit, then sighed.\n\"Excuse me.\"\nWith that, he placed a hand on Saint's shoulder and looked into her eyes.\n\"Hey… Saint, was it? Snap out of it.\"\nThe beautiful therapist looked up at her silently.\nNothing happened for a few moments…\nAnd then, her expression changed subtly. Her eyes widened slightly, and she seemed to hold her breath for a heartbeat or two.A slight crease appeared on her brow.\nShe lingered for a while, then coughed.\n\"I am sorry? What am I supposed to snap out of?\"\nEffie blinked a few times and glanced at Sunny before turning back to Saint.\n\"Uh… come to your senses? Pull yourself together? Get a grip!\"\nSaint stared at her for a while, then raised a hand and deliberately pushed Effie's away.\nHer eyes glistened with a barely suppressed emotion, and Sunny could hear the sound of teeth grinding against each other.\nSaint exhaled slowly, then inhaled deeply and closed her eyes for a few moments.\nOpening them again, she said in an even tone:\n\"Isn't that what I should be telling you three?\"\nShe paused for a moment, and then added in a low voice:\n\"...Damnation.\""

    "content": "2502 Foundation of Health\n\nEffie looked at Sunny with a confused expression. \n\"It… does not seem to be working?\"\nSunny was just as stumped.\nHe gave Saint a thoughtful glance, then scratched the back of his head.\n\"Well. Yeah… maybe it is because she is not a complete person? As one of my Shadows, Saint is technically a part of me. She usually resides within my soul… and before you say anything about a beautiful woman being trapped in me, know that I will break at least one of your arms if you do…\"\nEffie, who had already opened her mouth with a mischievous glint in her eyes, closed it again.\nSunny glared at her for a moment, then continued:\n\"Alternatively… it might be because of her [Stalwart] Attribute, which makes her immune to mind attacks. Her Mirage City persona was forced upon her by the Palace of Imagination, so it is not a mental hex — rather, it is a manifestation of divine sorcеry. So, your attempt to strip her of that persona \nmight be seen as a mental assault instead, consciously or subconsciously.\"\nHe grimaced.\n\"Or it could be something else entirely. Maybe the Castellan had stolen more of your authority in the last few days. Maybe it only worked on me that easily because I am a Supreme. It's… hard to say.\"\nEffie looked at him, then at Morgan. Morgan did not seem to know more about the Palace of Imagination than they did, though, so she looked back to Sunny.\n\"So what do we do?\"\nHe had no idea.\nSunny remained silent for a while, then opened his mouth to say something. At that moment, though, Saint shook her head and turned away with a determined expression.\nHe panicked a little.\n\"Uh, sorry? What are you doing, Saint?\"\nShe looked around the church, then said evenly:\n\"I am going to sleep.\"\nSaint headed to the nearest bench and pulled the white sheet off it, grimacing because of the dust.\nSunny blinked a couple of times.\n\"You're going… to sleep? Now?\"\nShe turned around and pierced him with a chilling gaze.\n\"It is far past my bedtime, and as I mentioned, my sleep schedule is very important. Good sleep… is the foundation of mental health. And since delusional disorders seem to have become infectious as of lаte, somehow, I must be vigilant.\"\nHer tone was letting them know that she would tolerate no compromises.\nWhipping around, Saint took off her coat, rolled it into a makeshift pillow, and settled on the bench. Soon enоugh, her figure was hidden under the white sheet.\nIt was as if she was telling them that she refused to deal with their nonsense anymore,at least not tonight. \nSunny, Morgan, and Effie stared in her direction with stunned expressions.\n\"Is she really… going to sleep? Now?\"\nThere was a hint of amusement in Morgan's voice.\nSunny lingered for a few moments, then cleared his throat.\n\"Well, you heard her. Proper sleep… is the foundation of mental health.\"\nHonestly, he could understand Saint's reaction.\nFiгst, she had met him and was exposed to a bunch of nonsense that sounded completely delusional. Then, someone tried to kill her. Then, Morgan broke out of the mental hospital аfter someone tried to kill her, too — not only that, but she seemed to share in the delusions of the crazy detective.       \nAnd after all that, Saint met Effie. Who also went along with the insane antics of the delusional detective and the escaped mental patient.\nShe could write off what Sunny said, and she could even try to explain why Morgan was playing along — after all, both of them were her patients, which \nmeant that their mental health was compromised by definition. But with the third person added into the mix…\nWhen three people confidently insisted on something completely insane, making you the strange one out for trying to cling to normalcy, even the most stable person would have no choice but to start doubting their own sanity. Considering that Saint had just survived a brutal attack, it was no surprise that she needed a break.\nOf course, Sunny had assumed that there would be no such problem because Saint would regain her memories.\nBut she had not.\nWhich posed a problem…\nHe frowned.\nIt was already bad enough not to have the full support of his fearsome Shadow. But in her current state, Saint was also vulnerable… and being hunted by Mirage City on top of that. Which meant that she needed to be protected.\nThe problem was that there was someone else who needed to be protected — the other Mordret. And Sunny could not be in two places at the same time.     \n'How inconvenient.'\nWho could live like that? Only having one body was seriously so frustrating!\nLetting out a sigh, he shook his head and looked at the boxes Effie had carried into the church from her PTV.\n\"Let's get to work. We'll need to change our plans a little.\"\nMorgan glanced at the boxes and raised an eyebrow.\n\"What work are we talking about, exactly?\"\nOpening one of the boxes and pulling out a stack of documents, Sunny smiled faintly.\n\"What else? Detective work, of course.\"\nHe pointed to the documents.\"These are case materials Effie fetched while I was busy driving you and Saint around. Everything having to do with the Nihilist case, as well as everything we have gathered regarding the recent attempt on the other Mordret's life. We might not be able to find the culprit just yet, but we can at least narrow down the list of suspects. Perhaps find a clue or two about who the Castellan is.\"\nMorgan tilted her head a little, then nodded.\n\"Makes sense. Let's get to work, then.\"\nShe leaned down to open another box… and froze with a strange expression on her face.\n\"Huh.\"\nSunny looked into the box and let out a heavy sigh.\nThere were no documents inside the box. Instead, it was filled to the brim with cartons of chocolate milk and packs of donuts.\n\"Effie… what the hell…\"\nShe looked at him with an expression of hurt innocence.\n\"What? You told me to get food, in case we'll have to spend a lot of time in the hideaway.\"\nSunny took a deep breath.\n\"Food. I said food. Not dessert!\"\nEffie blinked a couple of times, then smiled.\n\"Oh, I brought food too!\"\nShe pointed.\n\"That box. And that one. And that one as well…\"\nSunny rubbed his temples and suppressed a groan.\n'Maybe I should go take a nap, too…'"

In fact, it only took her a few minutes — five minutes exactly, actually — to fall into the embrace of sleep, almost as if there was a stopwatch built into her head.\nSunny was secretly impressed. He had heard that seasoned soldiers developed the ability to fall asleep on a dime, but never experienced it himself.    \nBy the time Sunny joined the Southern Campaign, he had already become a Master. People he had spent most time with were Awakened, as well, and Awakened had a complicated relationship with sleep… especially so in Antarctica, where the Nightmare Gates opening everywhere had made it so that every time they fell asleep, they risked never waking up again. \nHe stared at the sleeping form of Saint, then shook his head and picked up a carton of chocolate milk. \n\"Anyway, let's arrange the… wow. Why is this so good? What was I... oh, right. Let's arrange the documents first.\"\nUsing the materials Effie had gathered, they unfolded a map of Mirage City on the altar and quickly assembled a version of the investigation board hidden in the Devil Detective's wardrobe on its surface. \nAfter studying it for a few moments, Morgan raised an eyebrow.\n\"There is a lot of information… but it should all be useless, no? Even I know that the Nihilist leaves no clues behind.\"\nSunny shook his head.\n\"No, it won't be useless. In fact, it will be quite useful. Because the situation has changed — even if there were no clues before, there will be now. \nWe just need to find them.\"\nMorgan shrugged.\n\"Alright.\"\nEffie, meanwhile, studied the photos of the victims and asked in a dubious tone:\n\"There is something I don't understand, though. These people… they were all Mordret's vessels, right? But what were they here in Mirage City? Every one of them had a role to play, just like we play the roles of two police detectives. Did the Nihilist kill them because of their roles, or were they killed because they… were Mordret? How is that even possible? He should not have access to his Aspect here.\"\nSunny contemplated for a while, then responded in a hesitant tone:\n\"Maybe it's both.\"\nHe looked at the photos.\n\"First of all, I think I know why these people received roles in Mirage City. It is not very obvious, but when you think about it, something does not make sense. Where do all these people come from? The entire population of Mirage City, I mean. Not the Others themselves, but precisely the shapes they \ntake.\"\nHe looked at Effie.\"Your counterpart knew that the Devil Detective went insane when his former partner, the previous Homicide Division captain, was killed. That was the local version of Jet, by the way, but why? Jet has never entered the Great Mirror. Actually, Detective Sunless and Officer Athena had existed in Mirage City long before we arrived. How come?\"\nAt that moment, Morgan spoke:\n\"I can explain that. I noticed more than a few familiar faces here, so I considered this issue thoroughly, as well. And the conclusion I came to is that the Great Mirror uses the reflections of anyone who has ever set foot in Bastion as reference material… or maybe inspiration.\"\nShe pointed to the photos of the victims.\n\"Jet visited Bastion before, so her reflection ended up in Mirage City. So did you and Athena. So did I, for that matter. So, there were Others wearing our likeness in Mirage City.\"\nSunny nodded.\n\"That is what I suspected, as well. Then, here comes the interesting part. What if a person appears who has not one reflection, but many?\"\nLike Mordret.\nSunny remained silent for a moment, then pointed to himself.\n\"And a second question. What happens if a being whose consciousness inhabits several bodies enters the Great Mirror? I only sent one incarnation to Bastion, but what if all seven entered the Palace of Imagination?\"\nHe sighed.\n\"And lastly… what happens when a person who already has an established role in Mirage City — who is its axis, no less — has an evil twin, and that evil twin suddenly enters the Great Mirror, too?\"\nSunny chuckled darkly.\n\"I am willing to bet that the Castellan had no idea what to do with the real Mordret. Mordret is… an error, as far as the Castellan is concerned. So, it gave him a multitude of roles, and then arranged for all these people to be removed. The only one who did not receive a role, ironically enough, was \nour Mordret himself… gods. I just felt a little nauseated by having to call him 'our' Mordret.\"\nHe paused for a moment.\n\"Calling him the 'real' Mordret also does not work, either, since we don't know which one of them is real. So… what do we call them?\"\nEffie raised a hand with a smile.\n\"I know, I know! How about…\"\nSunny hurriedly interrupted her:\n\"Anyway, let's call them Mordret and the Other Mordret. The point is, Mordret was not given a role, and that was how he was able to survive without being slain by the Nihilist. He is like a ghost — someone who does not exist in Mirage City, or at least is not supposed to exist.An anomaly.\"\nMorgan raised an eyebrow.\n\"But how does it help us catch the Nihilist?\"\nSunny pointed to the investigation map.\n\"The Castellan killed every vessel of Mordret it could catch, but now that we are here, the story has been rewritten to give the killings a proper explanation. So now, they were killed both because they were Mordret and because something about their roles made them prime victim candidates for the Nihilist.\"\nEffie blinked a few times.\n\"The serial killer… was retconned? Is that what you mean?\"\nSunny shrugged.\n\"I guess? So, now, we can actually discover who the Nihilist is. In fact, we have quite a powerful advantage on our side, as far as detective work goes.\"\nMorgan tilted her head a little.\n\"What advantage?\"\nHe could not help but chuckle.\n\"Well… ironically enough, it is that we are not detectives.\"\nHe studied the investigation map and said in a measured tone:\n\"Everything in Mirage City has been changed to fit the new story, you see. The truth of what happened, the details of the identities of the victims, the evidence, the autopsy reports…\"\nLooking up from the map, he raised a hand and tapped his temple with a finger.\n\"The only thing that did not change is us, real people. And that is why we are аctually in a great position to solve this case.\"\nSunny pointed to the documents.\n\"Because we had studied the case before its story was changed. So, we don't really need to search for a needle in a haystack. We don't need to parse through all this information to find the smallest hint of a clue.\"\nHe smiled.\n\"We just need to find what has changed compared to how these documents were before. That is how we will learn what story the Castellan is telling.\""

Instead, she felt tired, dazed, and hurting all over. That was because she did not wake up in her comfortable, state-of-the-art orthopedic bed. Instead, she woke up on the hard surface of a church bench. Her luxurious cotton percale bedding was nowhere to be seen, either, replaced by a single dusty sheet of cheap and coarse fabric... naturally, her carefully selected pillow was also gone, supplanted by a rolled-up trench coat.\n\nShe had even slept in her clothes.\n\n...And only for a few hours.\n\n\"Unacceptable.\"\n\nTrying her best not to feel indignant, Saint sighed and sat up, rubbing her eyes. ‘Ouch.’ Her bruised body hurt. The cuts on her fingers stung, as well — the handkerchief wrapped around them had turned brown from blood and was sticking unpleasantly to her skin.\n\nShe was dirty, disheveled, and... grumpy. She felt disgusting.\n\nThat did not happen often.\n\nSaint looked around groggily.\n\nOf course, her clean and quiet apartment was nowhere to be seen. Sadly, she was still in an abandoned church, in the company of two unhinged detectives and an escaped patient. They did not seem to have slept at all — instead, they were sitting around a makeshift table, discussing something in hushed voices.\n\nThe hum of their whispering felt jarring in the echoing silence of the empty church. ‘Irritating.’\n\nSaint sighed.\n\nThe morning was a time for exercise, personal hygiene, self-care, and nutrition... ‘Oh, no.’\n\nSaint could not exercise properly because her body was bruised and battered after the altercation with the three brutes. Putting strain on it would only exacerbate the damage.\n\nPersonal hygiene was also a victim of her circumstance. She did not have her cleanser lotion, exfoliating scrub lotion, hydrating shampoo, and balancing conditioner, let alone her skincare and haircare products... all she had access to was bottled water to wash her hands and face.\n\nLetting out another grumpy sigh, Saint rose from the bench and did just that.\n\nAnything was better than nothing...\n\nWhile Saint was carefully unwrapping the hаndkerchief from her hand and rinsing the deep cuts, Detective Athena looked at her and smiled.\n\n“Good morning, sleeping beauty! There's toothpaste and a spare toothbrush in that box over there. Enjoy!\"\n\nSaint gave her a long, somber look. Some time later, she was done with trying — and failing — to make herself look presentable. Then, Saint was faced with another blow.\n\nNaturally, she treated all matters having to do with nutrition seriously. But her balanced breakfast was a pipe dream, at the moment... instead, she was presented with the food supplies in one of the boxes.\n\nA galore of ultraprocessed carbs, artificial additives, and chemical preservatives, all under a thick layer of high-fructose corn syrup.\n\nIt was basically poison.\n\n‘I can't eat that!’\n\nSaint stared at the box with a lost expression, not knowing what to do. Noticing her hesitation, Detective Athena smiled again.\n\n“Oh, there are also some donuts left! Treat yourself!\"\n\nLooking at her smiling face, Saint felt something that she had never felt before. ...The desire to smack another human being right across their face.\n\nHer eyes widened a little.\n\n‘I... am not okay.’\n\nAnd whose fault was that?\n\nTheirs!\n\nTaking a deep breath, Saint counted to ten and then said politely:\n\n“Thank you. But I am not hungry.”\n\nPicking up a bottle of water, she quenched her thirst and stayed motionless for a while. Now that her morning ritual — or at least a version of it — was complete, she could finally think about her situation.\n\nHer mood only grew worse.\n\nSomeone had tried to kill her. She did not know who or why. There were detectives protecting her, but their mental state was questionable.\n\nMorgan, the heiress of the Valor Group, had escaped from a secure mental hospital and was now here with her, acting as if nothing odd was happening.\n\nSo what was Saint supposed to do?\n\nGoing home seemed like an unwise decision, considering that someone was out to get her. Going to work was similarly problematic.\n\nRelying on her rescuers...\n\nShe listened to what they were saying.\n\nAt that moment, Detective Sunless was shaking his head.\n\n“It is still not enough. Sure, we determined that the past of the victims was changed to give them a connection to the Valor Group. The company of the guy who was supposed to renovate this neighborhood was a minor contractor for them, the young security guard was previously assigned to a different post, the older woman worked in an agency that provided outsourcing archival services for one of the Valor Group branches... but that is still not enough to pinpoint the exact culprit.\"\n\nDetective Athena answered in a carefree tone: “Yes, but if we add the attempted victims to the list — the CEO, two detectives who had been in contact with him, Morgan, and her psychiatrist — then the entire picture changes, doesn't it?\"\n\nMorgan shrugged.\n\n“There is nothing in my counterpart's memory to easily explain why she would be targeted. At least not on the surface — even if she knew something, I'd need to know what to look for first to find pertinent information.”\n\nDetective Sunless spoke again:\n\n“There are very few issues that would require both the CEO and his sister to be taken out of the picture. An attempted coup? That doesn't make sense, though... even if both Mordret and Morgan disappear, the power will simply return to Аnvil. We don't think that he's behind the Nihilist, do we? He's supposed to be out of the country, anyway.\"\n\nSaint closed her eyes for a moment. ‘Great. Now they think that I became collateral damage in some sort of power struggle within the Valor Group?’\n\nShe drank her water in silence, feeling miserable.\n\nBy then, the conversation had changed course.\n\n“Whoever the culprit is, they won't stop trying. We need to be ready to defend ourselves... which can be more problematic than we think. We are mundane people at the moment, after all, and our mundane bodies are quite vulnerable. Do any of you know how to use this thing? I pilfered it from the highly skilled, deadly, armed assassin who had tried to kill me.\"\n\nMorgan spoke next.\n\n“No. I never trained with firearms, let alone antique ones.\"\n\nDetective Effie chuckled.\n\n“What's so difficult about it? You just point it at the adversary and press the trigger, right?\"\n\nDetective Sunless did not sound too sure. “Well, I don't know. Their cars need to be fueled with flammable liquid, and their communicators only work half a day without being charged. Who knows what their guns use as ammunition?\"\n\nFrowning, Saint turned her head and then spoke evenly:\n\n\"This is a double-action, six-shot revolver... Smith and Wesson Model Ten. It uses thirty-eight caliber bullets. Also, don't pоint it at each other, please. You are detectives, so you should know how to follow basic gun safety.”\n\nDetective Sunless blinked a few times. “Actually, I have no idea. I was near a lot of guns in the Evacuation Army, but I neveг even fired one, let alone trained to handle one.\"\n\nThen, he smiled brightly.\n\n“But you seem to know your way around а gun, Saint! Well, of course you do. After all, you are a weapon master.”\n\nSaint frowned. What about her gave this bizarre man the impression that she knew how to handle a firearm?\n\nNot that she didn't...\n\nPursing her lips, Saint remained silent for a moment, then said reluctantly:\n\n“I do have a marksmanship certificate. I used to practice shooting to maintain a good level of hand-eye coordination.”\n\nHe nodded a couple of times.\n\n“Of course you did. Then, you keep it.\" With that, he pushed the revolver into her hand.\n\nSaint froze, startled.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nDetective Sunless smiled.\n\n\"You know, for self-defense. Next time someone tries to strangle you, blow their brains out. Alright?\"\n\nThen, after thinking for a few moments, he added:\n\n\"Actually, bash their brains out before they try to strangle you. Yeah, that would be way better...\""

    "content": "2505 Bold Solution\n\nSaint seemed to hesitate before accepting the revolver, but then gave Sunny a reluctant nod. She checked the gun with precise and confident movements, making sure that it was loaded, then hid it in the pocket of her trench coat.\n\nIt was hard to tell if she felt safer with a weapon since her expression was almost always calm and placid, but Sunny hoped that she did.\n\nBecause he himself felt troubled.\n\nBeing mundane was already bad enough, but he was at least confident in his ability to overpower most enemies in a brawl. Now that firearms entered the picture, though, Sunny had to face his own mortality.\n\nOne bullet was enough to end his life. \"How... nostalgic.\" He was reminded of his youth in the outskirts of NQSC, where armed thugs had been like deities who wielded power over life and death at theiг fingertips. It was such a long time since Sunny had felt threatened by guns that he was having trouble adjusting to this new old reality.\n\n“By the way, aren't we supposed to have those, as well?\"\n\nEffie's question made him scratch the back of his head.\n\n\"Right. As detectives, we have the right to carry firearms.” Sunny rummaged in the Devil Detective's memories for a few moments.\n\n“But they are under lock and key back at the Police Department. We can only take them out after providing a proper justification and filling out a bunch of forms.”\n\nGuns were a rarity in Mirage City, and even cops hesitated to use them. Still... maybe it would be prudent to retrieve their own revolvers from the armory sooner rather than later, considering that random assassins were running around with them. He sighed.\n\n“Anyway... where were we?\"\n\nThey had poured over all the available information last night, finding ways in which it was different from how it had been before. Luckily, Sunny had studied the investigation board in the Devil Detective's apartment at the start of their stay in Mirage City, so he knew what to look for. What they had discovered was that the victims of the Nihilist were now connected to the Valor Group in subtle, but undeniable ways. The owner of a construction company, the archivist, the suspiciously affluent civil inspector...\n\nAll of them were tied to the Valor Group, either оbviously or covertly.\n\nIn and of itself, that was a meaningless clue. After all, the Valor Group was too vast and influential — here in Mirage City, everyone was connected to it in one way or another. However, that clue ceased to be meaningless when one factored in one vital detail — that these connections had been formed only recently, in the process of Mirage City rewriting itself to fit the story of how the Nihilist chose his victims.\n\nIt was because of how the stories of these people had changed that Sunny could deduce that their connection to Valor was the reason for their deaths, as opposed to a mere coincidence.\n\nThe root of the matter still dodged him, though. Аt best, he knew where to look for it.\n\nSunny grimaced.\n\n“There are only a few hours left before we are suρposed to start interviewing persons of interest in the Other Mordret's attempted assassination case. That can potentially shed more light on the identity of the culprit... that was the plan yesterday, at least. However, today, I think that our plans were too conservative.”\n\nEffie arched an eyebrow. “Whad do you mean?\"\nSunny shrugged.\n\n“The city was not trying to kill us yesterday, so we could take our sweet time. But there is a deadline now — quite literally. So, we need to hurry things along.”\n\nMorgan, who had changed out of the borrowed nurse uniform into a spare set of clothes Effie had kept in the car, looked at herself in displeasure. The sleeves of the hoodie she was wearing were obviously too long for her, and the hoodie itself looked way too baggy on her svelte body.\n\nPursing her lips, she rolled up the sleeves and let out a heavy sigh.\n\n\"How are we going to hurry them, exactly?\"\nSunny remained silent for a few moments, then smiled.\n\n“Well, no matter how you look at it, there is one person at the center of all of this. The source of Mirage City... Mordret. The Other Mordret, I mean.\"\n\nHearing that, Saint frowned slightly, but did not say anything. She removed the cap from the water bottle in her hands and brought it to her lips, taking a measured sip.\nSunny shrugged.\n\n\"So, let's kidnap him.”\n\nSaint spat out the water, coughed, and looked at him with wide eyes.\n\n‘Huh. She can make that expression, as well.’\nEffie and Morgan remained more composed, but they seemed surprised, as well.\n\n\"Kidnap him?\"\n\nSunny nodded simply.\n\n“That is the easiest solution. Listen... we don't have a lot of time, and we have too many things to do. We need to catch the Nihilist, we need to protect Saint, we need to make sure that the Other Mordret survives — all the while staying alive ourselves. So, let's turn all these things into one thing\"\n\nHe pointed to the altar of the abandoned church, where Mordret's photo lay at the center of the investigation map.\n“We need to put him and Saint together to remove the need to split our forces for protecting them both in separate locations. We also don't know enough to find the Nihilist... so, let's make the Nihilist come to us instead. As long as we have the Other Mordret, whoever is trying to get rid of him will come for us, and that will be our chance to follow the traces back to the source.\"\nSaint wiped her lips with the back of her hand and pierced him with a glare.\n\n\"Now, wait a moment...\"\n\nMorgan spoke then, interrupting her:\n\n“He is already protected enough. He is the most protected person in the city. Believe me, I know — otherwise, I would have already killed him. So what good will kidnapping him do?\"\n\nSunny shook his head.\n\n“If the person pulling the strings is hidden within Valor, like the Other Mordret thinks, then his own security might represent the most threat to him. The same people who are meant to protect him might become his executioners.”\nShe frowned, but did not object to that line of reasoning immediately.\n\nIn that ensuing silence, Effie said with a dubious expression.\n\n“That might be true, but they will still protect him from us. So, how are we even supposed to kidnap him?\"\n\nSunny suppressed a smile, as if he had been expecting that exact question.\n“Elementary, my dear Effie.\"\n\nHe walked over to Morgan, placed a hand on her shoulder, and grinned.\n\n“We have his baby sister. I'm sure he's worried out of her mind right now... so, we just need to use Morgan as a lure.\"\n\nMorgan looked at him in displeasure, while Effiе smiled brightly.\n\n“Oh, I see. Sure, that makes sense.”\n\nAs the three of them gave each other calm looks, already thinking about the practical steps of what they needed to accomplish, Saint finally spoke again:\n“Wait, hold on. Wait a second. We are not seriously planning to kidnap the CEO of the Valor Group, are we? That... that would be insane.\"\n\nShe fell silent then, hearing her own words, and sighed.\n\nSunny grinned.\n\n\"Don't worry. We'll only kidnap him a little...\""

    "content": "2506 Behind Mirror Eyes\n\nStanding on the balcony of the Valor manor, Mordret looked at the vast expanse of the Mirror Lake stretching in front of him. The sun was rising, and the tranquil waters were starting to glisten with a beautiful golden light. Far in the distance, the magnificent silhouette of the great castle rose from the golden glow, looking like something out of a fairy tale.\n\nIt was a stunning sight, despite the hazy curtain of the falling rain obscuring it. Mordret smiled, enjoying the view.\n\nHe drank his morning coffee in silence, not thinking about anything in particular. These quiet minutes at dawn were the only time he got to spend at peace — later in the day, he was always busy with work, solving urgent problems and interacting with countless people.\n\nThose problems were engaging and enjoyable in and of themselves, but it was a different kind of pleasure. By the time the exquisite ceramic cup in his hand ran dry, there was movement on the gravel road leading to the manor. Noticing a luxurious black car arriving at the manor, Mordret sighed quietly.\n\nHis expression changed, betraying a sense of melancholy for a moment. Then, it was replaced by his usual simple smile, and he left the balcony.\n\nStill wearing his silk pajamas, soft slippers, and an exquisitelу embroidered viridian robe, he left his room and descended to the first floor. The maids, valets, and Sebastian were nowhere to be seen — opening the door, he finally found them, assembled in two neat rows outside the entrance with umbrellas in their hands.\n\n“Good morning.”\n\nPicking up an umbrella himself, Mordret walked out to meet the arriving car. The door swung open before the chauffeur had the time to touch it, and an imposing man climbed out of it, wearing a stern expression.\nThe man was tall and broad-shouldered, with a lean but mighty physique. He had dark hair and a thick, dignified beard. The expression on his noble face was harsh and austere, and his grey eyes were as cold as tempered steel.\n\nHe looked around coldly, and his heavy gaze landed on Mordret.\n\nThe man remained silent for a few moments, studying him somberly.\n\nThen, a wide smile split his chiseled face, instantly warming it up.\n\n\"Son!\"\n\nMordret smiled, too, hiding his melancholy behind that smile.\n\n\"Dad.\"\n\nBefore he could say anything else, he was encased in a bear hug.\n\n\"Come here, brat. How long has it been since we last saw each other? You are still too skinny... Sebastian! What have you been feeding this guy?\"\n\nIndeed, it was none other than Anvil, Mordret's father.\n“Where's mom?\"\n\nAnvil gave Mordret a conspiratorial smile and brought a finger to his lips.\n\n\"Shhh. She fell asleep on the way from the airfield. Don't wake her just yet.\"\n\nLeaving the protection of Mordret's umbrella, he took a few steps toward the lake and inhaled deeply.\n\n“Ah. The stench... I missed it!\"\n\nLooking back, he grinned.\n\n“Your mom and I have done some wonderful work in less fortunate places, and I wouldn't change it for the world. But nothing beats home, does it?\"\n\nAnvil turned back to the lake and chuckled, taking in the sight of the castle.\n\n“Look at it, rising from the water. Just as magnificent as it has always been... well, maybe a little more magnificent now after the renovations are done.\"\n\nSmiling wryly, he finally returned to stand under the umbrella.\n“[ I hear the castle is opening to the public soon. Mirage Museum, huh? Was thаt your idea?\"\n\nMordret nodded.\n\n“Seemed sad, to just look at it from a distance. Always outside reach... and empty. Like a mirage. So, I thought I'd let people visit it and look around. Getting the city hall to cooperate took a lot of work, but you know how these things are.\"\n\nAnvil nodded.\n\n“I do. And hearing you say that... I'm happieг than ever that I retired.”\n\nThrowing his head back, he laughed.\n\n“Now, let's wake your mother up and go inside...\"\n\nHis expгession darkened a little.\n\n“I am sorry we couldn't come back earlier, son. That stuff with your sister... you two had us very worried. If not for Madoc promising to look after you and Morgan, we would have abandoned everything and returned immediately.”\nMordret smiled faintly.\n\n\"Yes, Uncle was of great help. How about...\"\nAt that moment, his phone rang.\n\nLetting out a sigh, Mordret took it out of his pocket, looked at the screen, and accepted the call.\n\n“Yes. What is the matter?\"\n\nHe listened to whoever it was on the other side for a few moments, and then scowled.\n“What? What do you mean, they lost her? What about...\"\n\nThere was a muffled sound of a man's voice from the phone, and his expression became even more troubled.\n\n“How is this possible? I was told that the hospital in question...\"\n\nAfter listening for a few more moments, he ended the call and remained motionless for a while, looking into the distance with a worried expression.\n\nSensing his son's unease, Anvil asked in a calm tone:\n\n“What was that?\"\nMordret flinched, then looked at his father silently.\n\nEventually, he took a deep breath and said:\n“It was Uncle's assistant. Apparently, Morgan... she vanished. I don't know how this is possible, considering that the facility we chose for her was supposed to provide the best care around the clock, but I will find out.\"\n\nAnvil studied him for a few moments, then sighed.\n\n“That girl... I think I spoiled her too much. She really knows how to throw a tantrum! But before you blame your old man, remember that you spoiled her the most.\"\nA pale smile appeared on Mordret's face.\n“Of course I did. She is my little sister.”\nAnvil shook his head.\n\n\"Look at you, still covering for her. I heard that she really crossed the line this time... trying to hurt you? That is too much, even for her. Aren't you mad?\"\n\nMordret tilted his head a little.\n\"Mad?\"\n\nHe considered the question for a few moments.\n\n\"I'm never mad. I can't be mad.\"\n\nOffering his father a smile, he handed him the umbrella and sighed.\n\n“I'm sorry, Dad. I'll have to go deal with that... hug mom for me? I'll be back for dinner.”\n\nAnvil nodded.\n\n“Of course. Go do what you need to do... drag Morgan home, as well. I'll give her a stern talking to.\"\n\nMordret looked at him for a few moments, then turned away.\n\nOut of Anvil's sight, his smile dimmed a little.\n\nHe lingered for a bit, then headed inside to change clothes.\n\nBehind him, the waters of the lake were stirring, restless, as its surface was being pelted by the rain."
